Question,Answer
"Is there a ""Self"" the ""I"" the self identity-consciousness etc before birth?","I agree with Rodney Tavares's answer.
Yes, there is “Self” before birth (and after death also ) that is part of cosmic consciousness which gets incarnated in physical form.
That which is called Atman (universal self) in Hinduism, identical with the eternal core (cosmic consciousness) of the personality that after death either transmigrates to a new life or attains release (moksha) from the bonds of existence.
The soul (Atman) is our true-self. Which is eternal and on self-realisation we realise our soul (universal self) only.

"Why, all of a sudden, are people saying that Swami Jaideep is not awakened/ enlightened? What does he have to say to them?","Throwing stones and hiding hands is common when an awakened person will challenge their belief system.
If you browse their ‘activity' you will know either they are hardcore religious or affiliated to some organisation and full of jealousy, hatred, frustration and resentment.
Just browse their ‘Activity' tab.
When the truth comes out awakened one has to take stones and abuses.
Socrates was poisoned.
Jesus was crucified.
Buddha was thrown stones at.
Osho was jailed.
Those were not coincidences.
When Krishna said - Whenever Adharam will exceed its limit I will come.
Avatar of truth will come.
Remember that was the meaning of Krishna's statement.
Buddha was an Avatar of truth.
Mahavira was an Avataar of truth.
Osho was an Avatar of truth.
I don't care how many Devadattas are there to prepare elephants to kill me.
I am already gone.
I am Speaking the truth after millions of births, I have come to speak the truth.
Truth is maddening.
Let me give them a ‘run'.

Are enlightened people allowed to daydream or fantasize?,"What is left there to dream about after enlightenment?
What is left there to fantasize about after enlightenment?
Until and unless one has desires - even desire to be enlightened, one will never be enlightened.
Enlightenment is about emptying everything you know as life and life is a dream too.
On enlightenment, nothingness is reached though there was no destination.
Emptiness is gained but there is no hollowness.
All dreams and fantasies belong to mind.
There is no dream and fantasies left after enlightenment, there is just ‘ISNESS'.
Like the ‘ISNESS' of trees and birds, sun and moon, stars and sky.
That is why he shares love like a flower sharing his fragrance or the Sun shares his warmth without asking anything in return.
Dreams are desires and fantasizing is longing.
‘ISNESS' is, when dreams are not."
Why does Sadhguru say things in a complex way?,"Truth pierces, lies confuse.
Truth is absolute, lie is relative.
He tries to lead you from where you are.
When you succeed then master fails.
When master succeeds you fail.
But when both fail then confusion wins.
Creating confusion is not art it is a state of ignorance.
Ignorance is always insensitive and confusing someone is a sin.
Clarity is the key to soul-realization and confusion is a chaotic mind."
"Why do enlightened beings not use visuals (like process flows, art, etc.) to explain complex ideas to people who are asking spiritually related questions?","Language and symbols have meaning in the conscious mind because we accumulate them during our growing years.
Let's take the national flag as an example.
Does the national flag have any meaning?
We give meaning to it otherwise it is just a piece of cloth.
It is futile to use meanings which are rooted in the mind.
Enlightenment is beyond the mind. Whatsoever the mind can comprehend will always take you to mind only.
This is why mystics and masters have a hard time explaining something beyond the mind.
Truth can't be said. The moment you say the truth it becomes a lie. The very utterance of truth falsifies it.
The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao. 
The name that can be named is not the eternal name. 
The nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth. 
The name is the mother of ten thousand things. 
Ever desireless, one can see the mystery. 
Ever desiring, one can see the manifestations. 
These two spring from the same source but differ in name;
 this appears as darkness. 
Darkness within darkness. 
The gate to all mystery.
Laozi, Tao Te Ching
Enlightenment is about ‘ISNESS'. ‘ISNESS' can only be shared, it can not be given or explained in words.
All masters share their ‘ISNESS', Words don't have much meaning without the presence of the master.
Don't go on rambling words from masters.
And upvoting on quora.
Just find the living master."
"Instead of leading people to their ultimate liberation or enlightenment, why is Sadhguru more focused on making people work for his social initiatives and volunteering?","No enlightened master will involve in social initiatives, forget about leading people to work for social initiatives.
Because the biggest social service to humanity is to lead the people to the truth.
Expansion of human consciousness has always been the only concern of the enlightened masters.
After thousands of years, Buddha is born and he would be interested to lead people to the liberation of the soul.
His only purpose is to wake you up.
Have you ever heard? - Buddha’s Chipko movement?
Have you ever heard? - Bodhidharma talking about save Ganga movement?
Have you ever read? Kabir talking about green revolution.
Have you ever heard? Osho talking about women's liberation movement.
Have you ever heard about the ‘Project Elephant' initiative by Ramana Maharishi?
Got my point?

What happens when someone gets enlightenment?,"When singer becomes song - then there is singing but no singer.
When dancer becomes dance - there is dancing but no dancer.
When painter becomes painting - then there is painting but no painter.
When doer gets totally engrossed into doing then there is no doer there is only ‘doing'. In the absence of ‘doer' you get glimpses of enlightenment.
Rumi said, ""What you seek is seeking you"" and at some point, you will find that the seeker and the sought will become one.
When dewdrop merges into the ocean you become self-realised.
But then you find it is other way around:-
Ocean has merged into the dewdrop then there is no you and there is no way to find the dewdrop again.
Then there is no enlightened one then there is enlightenment only as vast as this cosmos."
Is it true that it's normal to lose your desires and interests after a spiritual awakening? I don't want to lose these things but I want to awaken. I still want to continue doing what I love doing now after awakening,"Don't worry - you will never lose anything.
Until and unless you have desires - even desire/want to be awakened, you will never be awakened.
Awakening is about emptying everything you know as life.
Nothingness is the goal of awakening.
By Deprogramming your conscious and subconscious mind and then you reach emptiness - utter silence.
Emptiness is not negative, you become limitless, boundless."
Is peace in philosophy an illusory and fictitious?,"Philosophy is foolosophy and yet another failed attempt to reach reality. Foolosophy is just another mind game, yet another noise. Philosophers are Foolosophers. They never get awakened.
Philosophy is worse than jokes at least humour brings some kind of relaxation.
Understand - mind is the problem.
By studying foolosophy you are playing with the mind only.
You can't reach silence and peace by playing mind games.
You need something beyond your mind.
What is beyond the mind?
The witness is beyond the mind because the witness is beyond the duality of the mind.
Whenever there is fear - just watch, just witness.
Whenever there is anger - just watch, just witness.
Whenever there is stress or resentment - just watch.
‘Watchfulness’ or ‘witnessing' is all you need to transcend the mind and beyond mind, silence and blissfulness reside."
"If reincarnation, soul, Rebirth, everything is true, Then how does The soul migrate to a new infant? Infact the birth takes place inside a mother by a process we know, Then how does the soul reincarnates?","Reincarnation, rebirth and soul are just words till you realize them, till they become your experience.
Don't vouch for concepts of soul, reincarnation and god.
It is all about swear words till you experience them.
Look at yourself - do you ever want to be born again?
I shall never want to (at least not as a human)- in fact, nobody wants to or given a choice everybody would like to be reborn as Buddha or Bill Gates at the Max, not himself or herself.
Though everybody wants to be immortal.
The reason is we love this life. This life is beautiful in itself.
And
Longing for another life is phoney and It is better to enjoy this very life.
Moreover, enjoy this very moment.
There is nothing beyond, below and above - it is right here and now."
Is time heal everything?,"Time doesn't heal everything or wounds rather mind is time. Memories are something that is already dead but mind lingers on to memories.
Life is only here and now, past and future are in your mind.
When you start to live in now then your wounds disappear automatically."
Does an enlightened person know everything?,"Yes, he knows everything that is NOISE of mind and which keeps us away from enlightenment - the truth.
Karma, knowledge and devotion belong to noise.
Truth can't be said, silence can't be explained.
The moment truth is uttered it becomes a lie; the very utterance of truth falsifies it.
People keep collecting noise in the name of Vedas, Bible and Koran.
They don't contain the truth, truth has to be experienced first hand.
Even God is a ‘noise' regardless of God of form or formless God. Your prayers are noise.
Karma, knowledge and devotion are ‘doing’ and silence belongs to ‘non-doing'.
These are just games of mind and truth belongs to silence.
Like darkness is the absence of light, silence is the absence of noise.
Silence is emptiness, which is limitless and boundless."
What is one quality you admire in people?,"Doubtfulness,
Why?
Faith is very mundane but doubt is something you have to endure.
There is a fine line between Doubtfulness and doubts.
Having doubts is a common trait of humans.
But Doubtfulness is something entirely different.
Doubtfulness means I want to know, I want to experience what has been said.
Doubtfulness means if this is the truth then what is false and if what I know is the truth then what is false?
I say:-
Doubt everything till you find something you can't doubt."
"What is the spiritual significance of ""imagination""?","When people ask me - which one quality one should possess to attain enlightenment?
My answer has always been - “good Imaginative power”.
Humans are story animals and stories are the biggest hurdle to the truth.
Storytelling has been part of our human evolution.
Imagination helps you relive situations by listening to stories.
By reliving the experiences of others you get rare insights of truth.
All the misinformation (BS), fiction and conditioning can only be removed by stories and fiction.
It Takes A Thorn To Remove A Thorn.
Imagination and a good imaginative mind is the first quality one requires to attain enlightenment."
"Some people say that “no one is 100% healed because healing is linear”, but would the Buddha agree with that once enlightened?","Healing is linear if you make a point in your mind and aim for it just like learning is linear.
Everything in mind is linear. That is why the mind is single-tasking but existence is multitasking.
But if you see that endless time is mind, then you jump out of mind and everything becomes sudden and instant.
That is why enlightenment happens as an explosion and healing and learning happen as a quantum leap. Everything gets healed instantly like a sudden clash of thunder.
Beyond mind, there is no time and space there is only ‘ISNESS' or presence."
"If during meditation you reach a point of no thoughts, then how do you recognize that state without thinking?","No-mind happens in gaps between thoughts.
Mind is ‘thoughts'. The moment you recognize state of no-mind - you are already running the ‘thought' of being in a thoughtless state.
That is yet another ‘thought' only - hence the mind is already there.
No-mind happens when you witness your thoughts choicelessly.
And witnessing happens at three levels.
Witnessing your body senses.
Witnessing your emotions.
Witnessing your thoughts.
The purpose of witnessing is to leap into no-doing permanently - Samadhi.
Mind is ‘doing’ and meditation is ‘non-doing' (meditation/non-doing happens in gaps between thoughts). But you can't directly jump into non-doing.
Witnessing is the bridge between ‘doing' and ‘non-doing' or witnessing is half-doing.
In witnessing there is no object and consciousness itself becomes important. That choiceless consciousness is the bridge to non-doing -Samadhi.
What is the conclusion?
Just witness to reach the witness within you.
The day you reach the witness within yourself, you will reach the witness of this universe (some experience it as a GOD).
Witness of this universe is just awareness - the fabric of this universe."
"Once you have started liking spirituality in this lifetime & started working on it, do you always remain the same in all reincarnations following this lifetime?","Reincarnation is a fairy tale don't vouch for it.
We are organisms and we shall die someday.
Don't be involved in concepts of soul, reincarnation and god.
It is all about swear words till you experience them.
Look at yourself - do you ever want to be born again?
I shall never want to (at least not as a human)- in fact, nobody wants to or given a choice everybody would like to be reborn as Buddha or Bill Gates at the Max, not himself or herself.
Though everybody wants to be immortal.
The reason is we love this life. This life is beautiful in itself.
And
You are never born twice.
Longing for another life is phoney and It is better to enjoy this very life.
Moreover, enjoy this very moment.
There is nothing beyond, below and above - it is right here and now."
Is it possible that studying psychology I could unintentionally stop my awakening process?,"Physiologists are no good at handling the mind problems. They never get awakened.
Physiologists are yet another hoax.
Psychology is yet another hoax.
Because mind is the problem.
By studying psychology you are playing with the mind only. Though it will not stop the awakening process but it will delay the awakening process.
You can't fight mind with mind. PERIOD.
You need something beyond your mind.
What is beyond the mind?
The witness is beyond the mind because the witness is beyond the duality of the mind.
Whenever there is fear - just watch, just witness.
Whenever there is anger - just watch, just witness.
Whenever there is stress or resentment - just watch.
‘Watchfulness’ or ‘witnessing' is all you need to transcend the mind and beyond mind, blissfulness resides."
"Is it normal to feel sadistic on the path of awakening? I find enjoyment in telling people truths that would be painful for them and go against their beliefs. If I act on this urge, I get into drama, which my ego doesn’t particularly like.","It is natural to share rare insights with people as humans.
Sharing is one of the human traits.
But you are not sharing out of compassion - you are establishing yourself as a preacher.
You are deriving pleasure as being someone who knows more than others know.
Understand this - first, you help yourself and become comfortable with new insights then work towards your liberation.
""You are not there until you are there.""
And…..
Remember:-

How do I criticise someone without hurting him/her?,"Never try to criticize anyone.
Just disagree!
And when you disagree, don't be disrespectful.
So…
Disagreeing without being disrespectful is a most respectable thing.
This way you remain yourself and being yourself is the most respectful thing and it is manageable and sane too.
But people love to criticize to prove they know more than you that satisfies their ego - ego needs struggle and approval.
Don't fuel their ego by arguing, just give a walkover and another person will stand lost and foolish - nothing to do.
I don't know how many of you will agree with me - but I disagree with you gracefully."
Is there a connection between shiny eyes and enlightenment?,"Yes, enlightened eyes are shiny and always fresh.
Look into the eyes of enlightened beings. The eyes of enlightened beings are directly connected to the soul.
The silence you feel in his presence and the stillness you see in his eyes is because of his direct connection with the soul.
And
Every soul is the heartbeat of the absolute that is why every soul is equally beautiful.
We come from the absolute one day we shall dissolve into absolute.
Eyes are not only doors to the soul it is the gate to absolute.

Is it possible to have a big ego and not realise it?,"Ego or big ego or small ego are false notions.
There is no degree of ego - ego is just an inflated or deflated state of the false-self.
Ego is in very essence is mind's ‘I' - which is false.
Your true centre is your true-self - which is never-changing eternal - a face before your birth.
Until you find your true-self you will remain phoney - always hankering for this and that, struggling between me and you.
Life is a play and you are YO-YO.
How can I know my true self?
Fall in love - you will have glimpses of your true self.
Just watch a baby playing - suddenly you will have the glimpse of something divine.
Everything good and divine we know happens in the state of egolessness.
Love, devotion and compassion are the states of egolessness and also doors to your divine self - true self."
Could fear be ended completely?,"Absolutely No.
As a human fear is built into us as a protective system - Guess what will happen if you don't have fear and a truck is about to run over you.
Fight or flight is a response built into us for survival.
I haven't met anyone fearless in my life though I have met many ignorant fearless people. I have seen many daredevil fools too. No intelligent person can be recklessly fearless.
Fighting fear causes Schizophrenia.
It is perfectly okay to have fear. After all, we are humans. In fact, no organism on earth is fearless. Every living being is afraid of ‘death'. - be it ant, monkey or snake. Only dead things can be fearless.
What seems more practical - ‘fear' has be understood.
Understanding of fear brings a kind of balance in you.
And you can have the courage to face fear by understanding it.
The opposite of fear is not fearlessness. Opposite of fear is courage.
Courage is not fearlessness.
Courage is about moving into the unknown despite having fear and uncertainty.
Courage is about saying ‘Yes' and taking responsibility for the consequences.
Courage is about saying ‘No' and being ready for consequences.
Courage means living life by heart."
"Why do people often get opposed by their family, friends and other people after spiritual awakening?","Reason:- there is a difference between spirituality and religion.
Religion is a map (ideology) to lead a saintly life.
Spirituality is the path of liberation from religion and ideologies.
Christian will disagree with Hindus. Hindu will disagree with Muhammadans. Religion creates disagreements and split - duality.
A spiritual person will accept all other religions as a necessary part of life but a spiritual person denies religions as an only path - because he has to go beyond God and religions and find liberation. To him, all religions and ideologies are fetters - prisons.
The awakened person seems like a threat to religious beliefs hence he is opposed by family and society."
Is there a difference between meditating with your eyes closed & your eyes open?,"Meditation happens with closed eyes and mindfulness happens with open eyes.
The only purpose of meditation is to transcend the mind and become meditation.
Mind is ‘doing' and meditation is ‘non-doing'.
When you sit… just be sitting….
When you watch… just be watching…
When you walk… just be walking…..
When you eat… just be eating…….
When you always remain available to present moment, someday you become available to your eternal ‘IS-NESS'.
Then you don't even have to meditate for a single minute.
Your…
Walking becomes meditation. Eating becomes meditation. Talking becomes meditation.
You become meditation."
How do you know if you become enlightened? I know this might seem silly but like what if something happens when I’m meditating and I don’t know what it is and I get scared (I’m 21) but I do not know too much on this topic. Can someone explain? :),"First thing first - you will not have to ask this question about enlightenment on quora.
Enlightenment is not something you can miss noticing.
Enlightenment is something not even birds in the sky and animals grazing in the ground can miss.
Enlightenment happens when you are not and only this existence is.
The whole existence celebrates the Enlightenment - earth, stars, sky, sun and moon celebrating.
Because….
Enlightenment is the celebration of life beyond human suffering.
This is rare that Jesus, Buddha and Krishna happen and it is like a piece of sky walking on the earth.

"Why, when I am watchful of my thoughts, do they disappear and fade away? Are they supposed to disappear while you are watching them, or am I doing it wrong?","Mind is noise. Mind is thought.
You just can't observe the absence of thoughts.
Who will observe?
The observer is the mind. Whenever there is a mind there is thought.
When you watch your thoughts without identifying with them your consciousness becomes choiceless, devoid of objects.
There are three states of Meditation:-
Alpha state:- when your consciousness becomes choiceless for outer objects and your body senses then the alpha state of meditation happens. There will be contents but the observer will stand aloof.
Theta state:- when your consciousness becomes choiceless for emotions also then Theta state of meditation happens. There will be rare insights.
Delta state: - When your consciousness becomes choiceless for thoughts (purified of body senses, outer distractions and emotions( emotions means past and future) also then Delta state of meditation happens. There will be absolutely nothing. This is called Turiya- The fourth.
When your consciousness is sterilised of outer disturbances, body senses, emotions and thoughts then your meditation happens. But thoughts will come and go. You will be moving between alpha, theta and delta states of mind before Samadhi.
When you watch/witness your thoughts choicelessly there are gaps between thoughts (this is where the meditation happens) and when you keep watching thoughts and emotions for months and years these gaps become longer and longer and one fine day one of the gaps becomes permanent and you enter the state of no-mind. One step more you enter SAMADHI - the turiya.
That is where an ‘observer is observed'.
Now, the mind doesn't remain the observer.
Consciousness splits into awareness and conscious mind
And
The awareness becomes an observer of the conscious mind and vice-versa.
Beyond Turiya there is one more state - Turiyatita - when the observer also disappears and only observing remains.
This is the point of no return - rare beings who attain it are known as ‘blue beings' like Shiva and Krishna.

How can a monk have a family?,"You can call yourself a monk and have a family. It is that simple.
But neither ‘having family' nor ‘becoming a monk' will lead you to enlightenment.
Don't become a monk….
Birds remain birds, animals remain animals.
‘Becoming' is a disease of humans ( or rather human mind).
Humans want to become something, something else but humans. You are always busy ‘becoming' not ‘being'.
Some become Hindu, some become Christians, some become Buddhist.
Whether you become a monk in a monastery or you become pope at the Vatican.
You will remain someone else.
You can't realise your true-self by becoming someone else.
You become your true-self by becoming No-One, Nobody.
EMPTINESS is your nature."
How can one become a monk without leaving his family?,"Don't become a monk….

What is the relationship between rapid personality change and psychological rebirth?,"As humans, we are born with the possibility - the possibility to attain expansion of consciousness as vast as cosmic consciousness.
Cosmic consciousness is the most creative force in the universe. It is as creative as the beauty of our planet earth and as complex as this creation.
Our consciousness is the prisoner of our ego ( mind's ‘I') which is formed during our growing years and which is subjected to social, religious and political conditioning.
The magic of human consciousness is that it can break the prison of ego and expand limitlessly which can be referred to as rapid personality change or transmutation.
Death of ego is called psychological death and psychological death is also the rebirth of a new consciousness (enlightened) which is free and more compassionate about life and humans."
Can consciousness know itself?,"What is consciousness?
Consciousness = conscious mind + awareness.
Awareness is a non-dualistic part of our consciousness. Which is ‘isness'.
Yes, consciousness can know itself. As awareness is the witness of everything happening now and here, awareness can witness conscious mind and vice-versa. That means part of consciousness can know other part of consciousness.
This very quality of consciousness is the reason for our free will.
This very quality of consciousness is the reason for the enlightenment in humans which is not available to any species on earth."
"If the entire universe is a coincidence/a thing that came out of nothing, why haven't we seen anything else that came out of nothing to prove it?","There are things we know. There are things we know that we don't know, there are things we don't know that we don't know yet there are things unknowable.
A part of the universe will remain unknowable because existence is ever-changing and that is where mysticism is.
To know the answer to this question you need to go beyond the mind.
The mind has to know things by what it already knows. This is the limitation of the mind. The mind has to work with what it knows to know new things.
And
Answers to the unknowable reside in absolute truth, not at anything short of it.
The day you reach absolute truth you will have answers only because existence has answers only.
Mind is a question. Existence is the answer."
My aunt is involving his 16-year-old son into Bhrama Kumari preachings and also sent him to a 7-day Rajyog course in Mount Abu. I am a bit worried. Is it the right thing to do?,"This is simply inhumane - how can you send someone as innocent as 16-years old for conditioning-CAGE?
He has not seen life yet. He is dependent on his parents. This is exploitation.
But I will not blame the mother because she must have had the desire for enlightenment. Now she is projecting her desire on her son.
It is sad how we destroy the innocence of our kids by imposing our desires on them.
One as a parent should understand giving birth to a kid is not life.
Life springs out of freedom.
Let him choose what he wants to do. He may not be right. We all make mistakes.
Mistakes are not bad but if you don't learn from them that is immaturity.
Life happens - No one should plan for it especially your life should not be planned by others."
Why does one suffer from depression after enlightenment?,"This is really something everyone should understand.
After enlightenment, nobody can suffer from depression.
Enlightenment is the permanent blissful nature of our being. Enlightenment is not a state.
Enlightenment is the point of no return.
But yes before opening the seventh and eighth Chakra kundalini can go dormant.
If somebody is facing depression and negative emotions - he/she is yet to realise his true-self.
It is kind of going in and coming out of no-mind. It can happen in the case of opening the fifth chakra.
Turiya is permanent - Turiya is beyond human consciousness.
Enlightenment means going beyond everything you know as life."
"Is enlightenment something that can be worked for, or is it only for the ""chosen one""?","Mahavir said - you should strive for enlightenment until you desire how can you know what you want?
There is time you should make a resolution and be determined to achieve enlightenment.
This is where one-pointedness is required.
Buddha said - you can reach enlightenment by being desireless and detached from the world - Vairagya and Sannyas are to be practised.
Still, there is the time when your desire to be desireless as the last desire has to be dropped. But this moment of utter desirelessness happens on its own here no method can work.
Now essentially enlightenment can be worked for to an extent. Even if you don't reach, your consciousness will expand exponentially.
And
It is better to have tried to attain enlightenment than to die regretting not having tried.
Remember it is always the journey that matters not the destination."
Is “brutally honest” an oxymoron?,"Of course. “Brutally honest” is an oxymoron.
Honest means living an authentic life. What is - what is……
If one thinks he is being brutally honest that is the way of ego. Ego loves oxymorons.
Ego loves conflicts and ‘brutally honest' is a beautiful conflict-creating oxymoron.
One who lives authentic life doesn't have to be honest also. He will live out of truth without thinking about any other way to live life."
"All spiritual gurus say to forgive people for your own sake, but does everyone really deserve forgiveness?","To understand ‘forgiveness' we have to understand ‘unforgiveness'.
‘Unforgiveness' is part of your ego. Ego needs conflict to survive.
Ego means misery - you can't forgive if you try to forgive - all you can do is to understand the stupidity of the whole game played by the mind as ego.
All that good we know as love, devotion and compassion are the states of egolessness.
The point is not to forgive, point is to forget so you become open to bliss. If you keep clinging to the person, you keep clinging to the past.
Yes, sometimes it is really hard to forgive someone but if you keep adding undeserving people to your list, your list will grow and then you will start living your life in past.
To forget you need to forgive so that you become clean of the cluttered past and become available to this very moment of joy.
Because…….
Life happens now and here."
"As Isha's IT team reported/restricted my last question, asking it again … Is Sadhguru or isha yoga is dissolving our energies and is it an irreversible process?","There is no such thing as dissolving energies - there is one energy and different manifestations.
That which is available for procreation is also used as lovemaking for fun.
The same energy is used as love for the lady and compassion for kids.
Yet another usage is devotion to God.
But when it is used as devotion to master and the master is a charlatan or someone not enlightened then this is the source of your misunderstanding and exploitation.
You are taken for the ride for personal benefits.
You should understand one thing only - enlightenment is your possibility and it should start with doubts, not faith.
Doubt everything till you find TRUTH you can't doubt.
PS : ‘Dissolving energies into nothingness' is a thought and also a recipe for Schizophrenia."
Do any Buddhists Practice Hindu Hathayoga?,"No, in fact - Hathayoga is like trying to fuel JET by horses.
Our body has evolved enormously what was effective 10000 years ago is no more effective to modern man.
There was the time our centre was navel at that time kriya yoga/yoga was enough for self-realization.
Then came the time when our heart became the centre then Bhakti Marg was the effective path.
2500 years ago our centre became mind then Dhyan Marg was effective - the time of Buddha.
In the last few centuries, our centre is way beyond head and heart - Now only Gyan Marg is valid.
Or
A combination of all paths will work."
I'm a 21-year-old Hindu and I want to convert to Buddhism. What will be the changes in my life if I do so?,"Religion is prison. How does it matter prison is made of iron or gold?
The grass is greener on the other side. There is not much difference between all religions - Every religion is a pond and you deserve the ocean.
Either you plop plop in the old or new pond or you can dive into the deep sea.
Either you remain caged or you can soar into the sky.
This journey to freedom will be arduous but the joy of the journey is determined by its complexity, hardships.
Remain Hindu and enjoy life.
Or start the journey to the divine. Become Buddha, don't be Buddhist."
What is the significance of asanas and pranayam for enlightenment?,"Nothing - Asanas and Pranayam are good for the body - body and mind are same thing and ‘doing’ is mind.
And
Enlightenment is beyond mind. In other words, until and unless you drop ‘doing’ and get rooted in ‘non-doing' you will not realise your soul.
What is good for the body is bad for the soul and what is good for the soul is bad for the body.
We need a balance like walking on a tight rope. Balancing right and left using a pole.
That means there is a place for yoga when you start your journey and there will be the time you have to drop yoga also.
After enlightenment yoga is good to keep your body healthy and energy pure."
"Is Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj’s “I am,” Krishnamurti’s “choice-less awareness” and E.

Tolle’s “the power of Now”——all are pointing to ‘isness' which is beyond the mind.
But all are direct approaches like Raman Maharishi’s - “Who am I?”.
These devices don't work standalone - you need the presence of a master or indirect methods like short stories, Koans and riddles.
Because when the finger is pointing to the moon then the mind looks at the finger, not the moon. This is the nature of the mind. This is the mischief of mind. The mind always takes shortcuts.
The mind has to be told 10000 times and in 10000 ways before it understands the subtext message lurking in words.
All-methods-combined works better than individual methods."
Can women achieve enlightenment?,"Yes, but after the mensuration phase, maybe around 50.
Why?
Before enlightenment, one has to become non-being for many months and mensuration is the reason women can't be non-being, they become conscious of their being every month.
Tao tantra can be used to stop mensuration but I find it unnatural.
For more information about mensuration read RTU VIDYA by Sinu Joseph."
Is Sadhguru a bluff-master?,"He is not bluffing - the fact is he is not enlightened.
What he is talking is normal motivational speech.
He copied most of the things (jokes and stories) from osho and he did it very badly.
He has a little knack of fiction writing and he is nowhere near Enlightenment.
Every enlightened master has his own unique way - but he is more of a charlatan copying the dress-up from Osho (enlightenment is about being original, authentic).
He is just a normal guy with few spiritual experiences and copying Osho and talking in circles only.
Don't give heed to all these run out of mill spiritual masters."
When will Sadhguru take Mahasamadhi?,"Don't worry - when death will come it will be called as his mahasamadhi.
There is no such thing as mahasamadhi it is just a word used by the enlightened people to assure that there is something beyond death.
GET IT STRAIGHT - it is just a WORD.
We all are organisms just like fish, birds and animals with the better brain.
Reincarnation, rebirth and God are devices to attain enlightenment.
The only thing real in spirituality is enlightenment - which is far away from Jagi."
"Why don't people realize the bluffing of Sadhguru about deeper dimensions of life, spiritual growth that he is talking for about 30 years? Has anyone experienced those?","He is not bluffing - the fact is he is not enlightened.
What he is talking is normal motivational speech.
He copied most of the things (jokes and stories) from osho and he did it very badly.
He has a little knack of fiction writing and he is nowhere near Enlightenment.

How do philosophers and early physiologists explain the mind-body problem?,"Philosophers and physiologists are no good at handling the mind problems.
Because mind is the problem.
You can't fight mind with mind. PERIOD.
You need something beyond your mind.
What is beyond the mind?
The witness is beyond the mind because the witness is beyond the duality of the mind.
Whenever there is fear - just watch, just witness.
Whenever there is anger - just watch, just witness.
Whenever there is stress or resentment - just watch.
‘Watchfulness’ or ‘witnessing' is all you need to transcend the mind and beyond mind, blissfulness resides."
"Why did the tradition of great spiritual gurus like Dayanand Sarasvati, Ramakrishna, Vivekananda, Aurobindo, Tagore, Ramana Maharshi, etc. suddenly stop after 1950?","All the people you mentioned were on the path to self-realization.
Out of all those you mentioned only Raman Maharishi and Ramakrishna(later in his life) were realised ones.
And all others are just footsteps for any novice who can walk into their footsteps but they were not realised one.
Though they were great intellectuals."
"Sadhguru says, ""Fear, anger, resentment, and stress are poisons you create. If you take charge, you can create a chemistry of blissfulness within yourself."" Do you agree with the statement?","Absolutely Not,
Fear, anger, resentment and stress are not the problem.
Your identification with these emotions is the problem.
All these are constituents of your mind or rather all these and opposites of these make your mind.
You can't fight mind with mind. PERIOD.
You need something beyond the mind.
What is beyond the mind?
The witness is beyond the mind because the witness is beyond the duality of the mind.
Whenever there is fear - just watch, just witness.
Whenever there is anger - just watch, just witness.
Whenever there is stress or resentment - just watch.
‘Watchfulness’ or ‘witnessing' is all you need to transcend the mind and beyond mind, blissfulness resides."
"After understanding samadhi, my question is what is the process of Mahasamadhi by will, where I sit in a place and within 21 minutes, I leave this body permanently?","There is no such thing as Mahasamadhi.
Though it is possible to leave the body at will by someone who is enlightened.
Nirvikalpa Samadhi is so intense if one will remain in it for more than 21 days he will die as the brain can't take the high blood pressure and the heart can't take high heartbeats for longer than 21 days.
There is a physical limitation of the body. 90% of the time as soon as one enters Nirvikalpa Samadhi, he dies.
When Buddha was dying his disciple asked him - where will you be after death?
Buddha had to use some words - he said I will attain mahasamadhi.
Mahasamadhi literally means death.
Disciples asked, “Will you be somewhere? Maybe in Nirvana?”
Buddha said - being somewhere means slavery.
Everybody is born awakened and dies enlightened - Very few live enlightened."

What is the difference between satori and nirvana?,"Satori is a glimpse of awakening.
Satori happens on the opening of the heart chakra.
When the heart chakra is opened then sometimes in great relaxation or devotion energy moves to the third eye and one starts to have short glimpses (Satori) of Awakening.
If you remain aware and alert then someday Satori will become awakening and awakening will become enlightenment.
Satori happens mainly in Zen tradition because they use koans and riddles as device.
Nirvana and enlightenment are the same, it is a matter of using negative or positive language.
Nirvana means blowing out the flame of desires and attachments - what remains is ‘isness'."
"If satori is not enlightenment, then what is the importance of satori?","Satori is a glimpse of awakening.
Satori happens on the opening of the heart chakra.
When the heart chakra is opened then sometimes in great relaxation or devotion energy moves to the third eye and one starts to have short glimpses (Satori) of Awakening.
If you remain aware and alert then someday Satori will become awakening and awakening will become enlightenment.
Satori happens mainly in Zen tradition."
"Is it possible to attain enlightenment (Buddhist context) through Christianity? Like following gods word, and having faith in Jesus? Can you become enlightened through having a deep personal relationship with god?","Religion and enlightenment have no relation.
No Christian,No Buddhist, no Hindu can be enlightened.
Religion is a prison, no matter it is Christianity, Buddhism or Hinduism and enlightenment is liberation.
Enlightenment is the death of everything you know as life. Out of death new life emerges - resurrected.
Enlightenment means you come out - Tabula Rasa and this is the point of no return."
How do you know if you are connected to your higher self?,"There is only true-self but out of ego, we love to call it higher-self.
Soul and true-self is the same thing.
Soul is something within you and beyond you.
We realize our soul in moments of egolessness.
Whatsoever nice we feel as love and devotion essentially is the state of egolessness - our soul.
Your true-self is devoid of an inflated or deflated state of your being (egoless state).
Surprisingly what you know as intuition is also something that happens in the state of egolessness.
Be in love or devotion and feel your soul - true-self."
Why does the mind always find reasons to be unhappy?,"The mind gets bored of everything - it gets bored of happiness also.
Whenever there is happiness it will skip to the sadness by making new desires.
Whatsoever it will achieve will become useless including the thing it desired for decades.
The underlying reason for its nature is duality.
Everything that happens in this world is dual.
When happiness comes to you it comes with inherited sadness.
Happiness and sadness are two sides of the same coin.
We cannot accept the opposites and that is the cause of our sadness.
It is our limited understanding of life that causes sadness.
But in reality, when we understand the nature of our mind and start living now and here - there will be no sadness."
Many masters said 99.9999% of people cannot get enlightened in this lifetime. How can I confirm whether I can be enlightened this time or not?,"This is the way of ego - you want to feel chosen even in spirituality.
Spirituality means moving into the unknown.
Spirituality means gamble of life.
If you want to know the truth you have to drop all your armours.
You have to stake all you know as life.
No, neither you can know it nor anybody can tell you.
If somebody is telling you that you are chosen one - be wary of him.
Run, run….
Don't look back…
Truth is to be told - 99.9999 % you are going to fail.
Now if you dare to fail a thousand and one times then that last one time might be your chance to be enlightened.
Remember : Beauty belongs to the journey, not to the destination."
Why do some people say that the whole concept of 'twinflame' is fake?,"Absolutely not,
Love has many manifestations.
Twin Flame is a theory for timid minds for the minds which are yet to evolve. This is a childish one-sided love game.
For little more mature minds love for God makes sense. It is same energy converted into devotion.
But for some who are daring and want to explore our existence beyond the mind - enlightenment makes more sense.
All are the reality of different dimensions.
And…
The ultimate alchemy happens when one becomes complete onto himself - Enlightened."
Can twin flames be born in the same year or be born at different years apart?,"Twin flames can be born in the same year and at different years also.
It is a matter of your choice because - assumptions are the key to spiritual relationships.
You can assume twin flame as a soulmate also.
You can have any number of twin flames and soulmates.
You can add one more twin flame as Karmic Partner.
You can assume your twin flame is dead if you don't like her/him.
Still not enough…
You can reincarnate someone else as a twin flame.
There is hundred of permutations and combinations, choose whichever helps you munch your mind.
Don't worry anything or everything will work.
All you need creative imagination and a heart full of fantasies, creative imagination is optional, fantasies are not."
"The most popular myth is everyone doesn't have a twinflame, I believe everybody has a twinflame and it’s just that we all have different timing on our journey. The universe may have diversity but not inequality at it’s core. What do you think?","What you think to be your twin flame is your tendency to find the experience of deep love outside.
We give examples of failed love and expect a successful love life. In history, all the love affairs that failed are remembered and not the love that succeeded.
“And they lived happily ever after” is the most misleading fact of life.
The real story starts after the honeymoon but our movies and novels talk about love affairs before marriage.
Your eternal love is not a twin flame it has been proved again and again, it's something else. It is your deepest love for your true-self.
There is a single eternal flame and that which you can't lose.
Try to understand you can't find peace and silence outside yourself. Life is not about dying for someone or something , life is a mystery to be lived.
Don’t ask for maps and missions.
You should halt searching for happiness in others. You should search for your true-self, which is eternal and beyond birth and death."
In Buddhism can an enlightened person or being ever lose their enlightened state?,"Buddhism and enlightenment have no relation.
No Buddhist, no Hindu, no Christian can be enlightened.
Religion is a prison, no matter it is Buddhism or Hinduism and enlightenment is liberation.
Enlightenment is the death of everything you know as life. Out of death new life emerges - resurrected.
Enlightenment means you come out - Tabula Rasa and this is the point of no return."
Which incident in life made you realize that you should live in the present moment instead of the past or the future?,"Realizing that one should live in the present is also a thought.
Just like people keep running the thought of being in a thoughtless state.
Mind is time - Do birds have wristwatches?
When the sun rises they wake up and when sun sets they sleep.
When they feel hungry they eat and when they are thirsty they drink water.
Nobody is there to tell them when to bathe.
It's all about being in now and here.
Understanding the futility of being in past or future helps but that doesn't put you in now and here as long as there is a mind.
To be in present you need to be rooted in no-mind.
How to attain no-mind?

"Can a person have 2 guru or masters? I have a guru/ master, but he is very good when it comes to solving day to day life or sansar problems, but not much of help in spiritual world.Is it possible to have another guru for spiritual progress?","The big enemy of good thinking is confusion.
No, you can't have two Gurus. People are already so confused and two gurus will add to your confusion only.
Guru is no good if he is providing clarity at the expense of comprehensiveness.
Buddha used to criticise Mahavira and Mahavira used to criticise Buddha as both were contemporary masters.
In one of the incident Buddha made fun of Mahavira when Buddha came to know that Mahavira was begging at locked house - Buddha said that Mahavira is so blind that he was begging in front of locked house and he used to say he was omniscient and omnipresent.
The reason was obvious - You will be better off not having a guru at all rather than having two gurus."
How do I find a spiritual partner to connect with?,"Path of spirituality is the path to your individuality by unmasking all the veils of conditioning.
The spiritual awakening is the realisation of being alone.
That is why it is called Kaivalya.
The whole Kaivalya Upanishad is about aloneness.
Aloneness doesn’t mean loneliness. Loneliness is ugly and aloneness is our reality.
The ultimate alchemy happens when one finds himself standing on the edge of the earth and about to jump into the abyss of aloneness.
Turn around and take one last look - The whole world dies.
When you die, your body dies.
When your ego dies then the whole world and its attachments die.
Spiritual awakening means taking out beads of attachments one by one from the garland of worldly life.

"How do we recognize which chakras the Kundalini has cleared and opened and which chakra it is now in? If you feel the Kundalini is rising all the way from the root to the head, does it mean the chakras are open and clean?","The opening of the first two chakras happens in sleep state.
That means you don't even know if chakras are opened or not.
Remember everybody is half-man and half-woman.
The layout of Chakras in males is:-
The first chakra is male and the second chakra is female, the third chakra is male and the fourth chakra is female so on….
When an orgasmic meeting happens between the first chakra and the second chakra - the first psychic knot (Brahma Granthi) opens. This happens in sleep state.
When an orgasmic meeting happens between the third chakra and the fourth chakra - the second psychic knot (Vishnu Granthi) opens. This happens in dream state.
When an orgasmic meeting happens between the fifth chakra and the sixth chakra - the third psychic knot (Rudra Granthi) opens. This happens in waking state.

Opening of chakras happens either through IDA Nadi or PINGALA Nadi.
You can feel the energy moving through Sushumna Nadi only - which happens after the opening of all the Granthis otherwise only two chakras are open in your case.
Everything else you are feeling is just blockage at the third chakra.

The layout of Chakras in females is:-
The first chakra is female and the second chakra is male, the third chakra is female and the fourth chakra is male so on….
When an orgasmic meeting happens between the first chakra and the fourth chakra - the first psychic knot (Brahma Granthi) opens. This happens in dream state.
When an orgasmic meeting happens between the second chakra and the fifth chakra - the second psychic knot (Vishnu Granthi) opens. This also happens in dream state.
Brahma and Vishnu knot open simultaneously.

Does ego go with only when a person is liberated?,"Ego is your mind's ‘I'. It is a framework just like the skin is a container of bones and muscles, ego is a container of the mental body which you refer to as ‘I'.
Though after death everybody is liberated, beauty is to be liberated while being alive.
Ego doesn't go or die when you are liberated. Rather you get disidentified from ego and your ego remains but you get separated from it.
Now you become a witness of your ego."
Is it necessary to start chakra meditation from the root chakra?,"Absolutely YES,
Always start chakra meditation from the root chakra.
The first four chakras are chakras of duality.
Kundalini energy keeps moving between these first four chakra.
Most of the people who have had spiritual experiences are stuck at the solar plexus chakra. They keep having spiritual experiences all their life. Because the opening of the first two chakras happens in sleep mode.
I have rarely met someone with more than first two chakras opened.
The third chakra is related to the ego and one can rarely forego ego in Samsara.
So don't bother about the rest of the chakras as these can't be opened by chakra meditation.
You can only balance chakras by meditation.
Hence it is always necessary to start chakra meditation from the root chakra. Don't skip chakra, don't over meditate. Balancing means giving equal attention to each chakra."
Does smoking cannabis lead to spiritual awakening?,"Smoking cannabis can't cause spiritual awakening rather it can create psychiatric disorders.
Though many tantra traditions have used marijuana and other psychedelic substances for spiritual awakening successfully.
Maharajji (Neem Karoli Baba) said that smoking charas(hashish) or ganja(marijuana) or eating bhang(ingested marijuana) was okay.

George Gurdjieff, a Russian philosopher-mystic used alcohol for spiritual awakening of his disciples.
Author of “Be Here Now” and proponent of LSD - Ram Dass ..."
Isn’t it a blasphemy to declare that 'I am God' as the Advaitins do? Do they really say so or they are being misunderstood?,"When you find the one who is seeking inside of you then you find the seeker that was seeking itself.
The cycle is completed. Now, the realisation that remains is:-
Aham Brahmasmi
I am divine.
I am God.
That is why mystics say God is inside you."
What are some of the most practical ways to develop the habit of dispassion without going to the Himalayas?,"Vairāgya (detachment, or renunciation, dispassion) happens.
If you are planning to practice dispassion then it is going to be on the periphery.
Dispassion, renunciation should come from your inner core.
As a general guideline:-
Things that force you to meditate will instigate Vairāgya.
When you meditate your consciousness expands then your passion turns to the compassion to know life.
Birth is not life.
Birth is the possibility of life and most of people don't know life. They think birth is life. Life can be lived by knowing life only otherwise most people live unconsciously and die without knowing life.
As consciousness grows, your consciousness falls back onto itself and it becomes choiceless.
Choicelessness is the first step to Vairāgya. Renunciation stems out of Vairāgya.
And
In the moments of deep renunciation, your passion, relations and profession all become meaningless.
If you go to the Himalayas and keep thinking about your wife and kids then that is not Vairāgya.
And if you live with your wife and kids and keep thinking about going to the Himalayas that is not life either.
In both cases, you remain split and confused. You miss the point.
Let the life happen, wherever you are.
Don't overthink and let the life flow.
"
How do I truly listen to my intuition and co-create with the universe?,"As long as you have ‘I' as a doer you can't have intuition.
Intuition happens in the deep recesses of your being in communion with existence.
Co-creation can happen when you become one with the universe.
How do I truly listen to my intuition and co-create with the universe?

Why have I been seeing so many triple numbers lately? Is it in regards to my twin flame? I am especially curious about 222 and 555.,"You can see what you want to see. Mechanism of mind is as such that if you keep looking for God, someday God will appear.
These numbers are man-made.
Do you know why do we have base 10, not 12–18?
Because man used to count on fingers and we all have 10.
There is nothing spiritual about all these man-invented numbers.
If you ask someone to go out and look at all colours, a person is likely to notice dominant colours - red in roses, orange in marigold, yellow in daffodils.
And
If you ask the same person to look out for the colour blue, then his attention scan would be much more comprehensive and selective. Such is the case of seeing 222, 333, 555.
Other way to look at it is Cause and effect.
First, you start to look for some number e.g. 555 unconsciously now you take it as effect and then you try to find all possible causes and select which supports your story you are running in your head.
Look at foolishness:- People waste years or decades in this mind game because they don't want to change or somehow their ego is hurt so badly that they remain stuck to a simple mind trick.
Don’t waste your time in mundane meanings of life events.
Life is a mystery to be lived, a joy to rejoice.
Don’t try to take control of it.
Life happens, death happens and everything in between happens."

Why did a life event prompt you to start meditation?,"Life events that lead to one of the following prompts you to start meditation:-
Physical Death:- Any near-death event like an accident or serious disease causes one to pray and meditate.
Emotional Death:- Death of the near one or divorce or break-up causes one to pray and meditate.
Professional Death:- Death of the profession or business causes one to opt for prayer and meditation as it happened to many in lockdown. The impermanence of everything is revealed to you.
Psychological Death:- Death of ego like insult and identity crisis also causes one to pray and meditate.
Why do all kinds of death prompt one to meditate?
Meditation makes you deathless."
Is spirituality becoming a trend?,"If I can't be Jeff Bezos, why not, become Buddha.
I have succeeded in my professional life, I can be successful in spirituality also. Let's explore spirituality.
Either spirituality is an escape or an alternative.
But one thing is sure both points of view are wrong.
People fall for spirituality for all the wrong reasons.
Spirituality is about staking yourself to find answers to the deepest questions of life.
One who is ready to die to know true-self is spiritual."
"If an awakened person does not invest energy in their appearance (ex: fashion, weight, makeup, hairstyles, manicures, etc.), then does that mean any desire to lose weight is proof the person is not truly awake?","Awakening is an over-glorified concept.
Awakening simply means expanded consciousness to its fullest possibility.
Like the birth of a child is a possibility of consciousness and how much it grows it will depend on the life curve of the child and his efforts.
Likewise, awakening is a second birth with a full possibility of expansion of the consciousness.
If a person is awakened he is supposed to be conscious of whatsoever he is doing. It has got nothing to do with his preferences in his life.
If a Russian is awakened then, will he stop having Vodka? Because of the weather in Russia, everyone drinks Vodka so will he.
An awakened person doesn't need to live like Buddha or Raman Maharishi.
He can prefer to live like a rock star. Look at Jaggi and Osho.
But, more importantly, things to look out for - he must live what he preaches. Awakening is about an authentic life.

"People say there is no such thing as enlightenment. Why does it mention it in the Tibetan book of the living and dying, as it is something to be attained?","There is no reincarnation.
There is no rebirth.
There is no soul.
There is no God either.
These are all devices to attain enlightenment.
Because there is only one true thing in spirituality - ENLIGHTENMENT.
There is a true nature of all of us which is eternal one which was before birth and also remains after death. That which is never wavering and that which never dies.
Everything else is just an arrangement to attain that which is absolute."
"What is it called when you are asleep, but you remain aware of the passage of time?","This is one of the states of mind where your consciousness becomes choiceless and it is called the alpha state of mind.
It is more like watching a movie without involving in it. It is more like being witness to whatever is happening and consciousness remains vaguely aware of the passage of time.
Alpha state of mind leads to theta state of mind and if you remain alert theta state (rare insights) of mind leads to the delta state (absolute reality) of mind."
"After taking Shaktipat from Guru, will you have a spiritual ability like Siddhi?","Shaktipat is very powerful transmission of energy, it has advantages and repercussions also.
Shaktipat is performed on initiation of disciple but it is misunderstood by people that initiation can happen just by finding the right Guru.
It takes years before disciple is initiated by Shaktipat. Shaktipat requires total surrender, which happens after years of association with the right master. In sufi tradition initiation by shaktipat happens after 5–6 years of association with master.
[ Beware of the people who claim to perform Shaktipat very first day as it will result in unintended psychological consequences or side-effects]
There are two initiations:-
1) When the disciple surrenders his/her past to master (formal).
2) When the surrender of the disciple is completed (ego is dissolved in devotion) and this is the point when Shaktipat happens (spiritual initiation). There can be multiple shaktipat to remove the blockages in chakras.
Shaktipat can't be delivered also it happens when surrender of disciple is complete and egoless master as medium meet. Shaktipat requires egoless medium (Enlightened Master/ Guru) hence if somebody says he can deliver Shaktipat, be wary of him.
An egoless medium can't claim to deliver Shaktipat. Shaktipat happens in the great communion between Divine-Master-Disciple.
As a true seeker you should not believe in miracles. Siddhis is yet another power-trip. What you seek in this world now you are seeking in divine. Sidhis is a path of ego.
Why are you interested in siddhis in first place?
Remember search for power is not the search of true seeker. Siddhi - the power to do miracles is a vicious circle of ego-trip. Once your words begin to come true, your confidence will grow and you will feel more powerful. The more your words come true , the more you will feel yourself to be supernatural.
These siddhis are greatest obstacles on the path of self-realisation. One should keep clear of them.

"How does someone with natural healing abilities (sensations in hand, empath, intuitive) develop these skills or possibly to improve clairvoyance?","With the opening of the heart chakra (fourth chakra) healing abilities are developed.
Heart chakra opens when someone lives by heart and devotion and love become a way of living life. Heart chakra gives balance to life.
Clairvoyance abilities come with the opening of the third eye (sixth chakra - some with fifth chakra).
With the opening of each chakra, your consciousness expands and you accumulate many abilities.
But these abilities have to be sharpened by practising otherwise you might harm yourself or other persons.
While developing self-therapies and experimenting with energies I have harmed myself many times and sometimes it took me to recover from psychological problems and energy flow blockage many weeks.
With great power comes great responsibilities."
Is there a way to scientifically demonstrate or prove the idea of nirvana/samsara/enlightenment? How do we know that these ideas have any objective reality?,"Certainly not,
But you can have a glimpse of Enlightenment.
The only thing any enlightened person can share that is his presence.
In the presence of an enlightened being, you will have glimpses of enlightenment.
But you need to feel his presence by heart and a doubtful mind will miss the point.
Mind is the only wall between you and enlightenment. Those who live by heart, live closer to enlightenment."
"Why I am not feeling passionate about music anymore which is my passion and profession. In the journey of spirituality, as the awareness is increasing, passion is shifting towards knowing life.Is it common to loose intrest in all other things?","When consciousness expands then passion turns to the compassion of knowing life.
Birth is not life.
Birth is the possibility of life and most of the people don't know life. They think birth is life. Life can be lived by knowing life only otherwise most people live unconsciously and die without knowing life.
As consciousness grows, your consciousness falls back onto itself and it becomes choiceless.
And
Vairāgya (detachment, or renunciation, dispassion) happens.
In the moments of deep renunciation, your passion and profession become meaningless.
This is the time you need to be alert because most people fall back to mundane worldly life again and again. The charm of worldly life is very deep into us - it is in our blood and marrow.
Be alert and meditate."
"I am going through a spiritual awakening and during meditation, I experienced extreme heat in my sacral chakra. Does anyone know what this means?","Kundalini is awakened and when the orgasmic meeting happens between the first chakra (Muladhara chakra ) and Svadhisthana chakra you feel extreme heat in Sacral Hara Chakra (Svadhisthana chakra).
As you are full of doubts kundalini doesn't enter Manipura Chakra ( Solar Plexus chakra). It gets settled in Svadhisthana Chakra ( Sacral Hara Chakra).
If you leave doubts and surrender to existence then energy will rise to Anahata Chakra (Heart Chakra)."
Does time heal all wounds or does time wound all heals?,"Time doesn't heal wounds rather mind is time. Memories are something that is already dead but mind lingers on to memories.
Life is only here and now, past and future are in your mind.
When you start to live in now then your wounds disappear automatically."
"Why do people become so narcissistic after they become ""spiritually awakened""?","There are seven levels of consciousness. ( Exactly 7 - 8th chakra is connected to the divine and 9th chakra is the bridge between divine and material world).
Every level of consciousness brings a lot of experiences.
After meeting/ interacting with thousands of people I came to know all those who are narcissistic, doubtful and zombies are the people stuck at second chakra and they THINK they are enlightened (anything less than enlightenment won't be accepted by their ego).
The second chakra (Sacral Hara Chakra) represents death - this is where your prana leaves your body on death and it is very difficult to overcome the fear of death.
Why?
Whenever there is a danger to life, the human body tries to procreate ( this is default nature's call ) and energy rushes towards the sex centre then people either waste their energy in watching pornography and masturbating or have alcohol to ease the fear (or all). There they waste their vital energy*. With repeated pattern - masturbation, smoking or alcohol become an addiction (or all three).
There are generally three kinds of fears:-
Fear of death.
Fear of getting mad.
Fear of premature ejaculation.
The next chakra (third chakra) is connected to the ego ( mind's ‘I') and it is very difficult to overcome the ego. The death of the ego feels exactly like the death of the body and the same pattern is repeated*.
What is the quick fix?
Learn to die gracefully - out of that you will live your life courageously, dangerously. Death is not the end - death is the culmination of all that you lived. Death is the crescendo of life.
And
Meditate…..
Meditation makes you deathless.
Out of deathlessness, great silence will emerge and that silence will give you life beyond birth and death - free of all habits good or bad because habits in themselves are bad.
While working with people and interacting with people I have not come across a single person with more than two opened chakras ( though sometimes when people meet me they do feel devotion and out of devotion they cry and shake get purified - their heart chakra opens).
That is why enlightenment is rarest of rare.
Mark my words - it is very rare that you will come across an enlightened person all your life."
"If enlightenment involves the death of the ego, why don’t people with lesser egos become enlightened faster and easily?","You failed to understand ego.
Ego is the mind's ‘I'. That mind's ‘I' gets identified with body and mind.
It has nothing to do with a lesser or greater ego.
When we talk about enlightenment, we are talking about the death of the ego or the mind's ‘I'.
And
Death of mind's ‘I' feels exactly like the death of the body.
Conclusively, one who is ready to die will attain enlightenment regardless of the degree of ‘ego'."
Have people who were skeptical in the beginning still managed to benefit from meditation?,"Meditation is not about benefit and loss.
Meditation is about going beyond so-called benefit and loss.
People want to practice meditation to avoid sorrows but remember when you will enter into meditation - sorrows and happiness, benefit and loss all will disappear - you will experience silence and peace.
Meditation happens to those who are ready to leave avoidance of sorrows and enchantment of happiness.
Sorrows and happiness, benefit and loss are part of your dream and all of them don't exist.
When you will wake up from the dream you will find sorrows and happiness are the tense states of mind.
Beyond sorrows and happiness, benefit and loss great silence resides and that is meditation.

Former Sadhguru said only people with great intellect can truly understand what Jiddu Krishnamurti said. What do you think?,"Yes, only great intellects can understand Jiddu Krishnamurti.
Because J. Krishnamurti was not enlightened and whatsoever he spoke is work of the intellectual mind.
What is written by the mind can only be understood by the mind.
Only words of enlightened being can be understood by heart. Because words of enlightened beings are spoken by the heart.
Words of mind penetrate mind and words of enlightened being penetrate the heart."
What is the difference between consciousness and awareness?,"Consciousness = Conscious mind + AwareNess.
Awareness is just is-ness without subject, object, doer and doing.
Consciousness has subject and object or consciousness has duality. But when consciousness is choiceless then there is no subject and object, there is no doer, there is doing (witnessing) only, and you are just witness, consciousness itself becomes important.
Krishna uses three words: karma, akarma and vikarma, meaning action, inaction and non-action.
What is the action?
According to Krishna, the action is that which you do as a doer, as an ego. A doing with a doer, in which one thinks of himself as a doer, is action. As long as ‘I' remains a doer, whatever ‘I’ do is action.
Inaction is just the opposite kind of action; it is action without a doer. Inaction does not mean the absence of action, but it certainly means the absence of the doer. An egoless action is an inaction. If the centre, the ego, the I, the doer, ceases and the only action remains, it is inaction. Action without a doer is inaction.
What does Krishna mean by non-action?
Where there is neither a doer nor a doing, yet things happen, there is non-action. For example, we breathe, which we are not required to do by our effort. There is neither a doer nor a doing so far as acts like breathing are concerned. Similarly, the blood circulates through the body, the food is digested, and the heart beats.
How can you categorize such an act?
They come in the category of non-action, which means action happening without a doer and without doing - that is what awareness is."

"Will Enlightenment carry on to the next life? If not, why try to attain it?","Neither there is next life nor there is any need to attain enlightenment.
But if you live one day of blissful enlightened life you will live millions of lives in one day.
Just imagine……..
No moving thoughts - no desire - no attachment - no mind at all.
You will create desires at will. Neither Sorrows nor happiness will move you. You will love everybody without attachment - you will do just enough to live.
You will need three pairs of clothes and two pairs of shoes.
You will eat everything joyfully.
You will live like a wildflower- who will spread the fragrance of compassion without discrimination no matter if somebody is there or not. Whoever will cross will be showered by the fragrance of you.
It will be the joy of being love and compassion. It will be the joy of being Sun and moon.
Your life will be an inspiration to all who are there and generations to come.

What are some ways to stop thinking and start meditating and deal with intrusive thoughts?,"Thoughts are moving energy. The mind is moving energy. Thoughts are mind.
The mind can't be stopped PERIOD.
The trick is to cut the fuel supply.
What is the fuel of mind?
The very thought of stopping and dealing mind is the fuel of mind and thoughts.
How to cut the fuel supply of mind?
Witness your thoughts - stand aloof - let the thoughts come and go. By and by your thoughts will become powerless.
There will be gaps between thoughts. Meditation happens in these gaps. If you keep meditating for years these gaps will become longer and longer, one fine day one of the gaps will become permanent - you will enter the state of no-mind.
Then you don't have to meditate even for a minute. You will always be in meditation while walking, eating and sleeping.
You will become meditation.

"How can I surrender to my awakening? I left the corporate world 3 years ago as an executive always busy and doing. As I go through my awakening process, I am not motivated to do anything anymore.","How can I surrender to my awakening?
Surrendering to awakening means you have deep desire of spiritual awakening.
You can desire anything but not Awakening. Awakening happens as a result of utter desirelessness.
When your desire to be awakened also dies you suddenly awake.
I left the corporate world 3 years ago as an executive always busy and doing.
You still have a sense of sacrifice and (that is why you mentioned it in your question) you have a big ego as someone who was an busy executive.
You are still an executive who left the position.
As I go through my awakening process, I am not motivated to do anything anymore.
You are regretting as you couldn't find what you expected.
Conclusion:-
You failed to understand spirituality."
Is it normal to feel own body shaking during meditation?,"Shaking of the body happens because of spontaneous kriya.
Your kundalini is activated and when energy reaches the second chakra (Sacral Hara Chakra) and it tries to transcend the second chakra then shaking of the body happens.
Don't worry it happens to very fortunate ones.
Keep meditating, kundalini is very intelligent and it will guide you.
PS: Some people go through deep breathing that is also spontaneous kriya."
"Is the atma of a mosquito and a human equal? If no, then in what sense? If yes, then in what sense?","No mosquito, no bird and no animal has soul (Atma).
Only humans have souls, because humans have freewill.
A mosquito will die as a mosquito, an eagle will die as an eagle and a lion will die as a lion.
Only humans can become devil or divine also. Rapists, murderers are examples of humans becoming devils. Krishna, Buddha and Jesus are examples of humans becoming divine.
Only humans have souls/Atma.
There is a difference between Atma and Jivatma.
When Jivatma is born and dies it pertains only to the sarira (gross body) with the senses, mind, intellect, etc, and not the atma which is nitya (eternal) and of chaitanya swaroopa (pure consciousness) . Unlike the Sarira (Gross body) the Atma (soul) is not bound by birth and death.

"After enlightenment, whom did he (Osho) contact first?","“Can you even drink beer?”, They asked.
I said, “Bring it!”
That was the first day I tasted beer. They could not believe their eyes.
They said, “You have completely gone down. You have become completely unspiritual. What are you doing?”
I said, “Enough is enough.” And in seven days I completely forgot the whole project, and I forgot it forever. The seventh day it happened – it happened just out of nowhere. Suddenly all was light; and I was not doing anything, I was just sitting under a tree resting, enjoying. And when I laughed, the gardener heard the laughter. He started to think that I was a little bit crazy, but he had never seen me laugh in that way. He came running. He said, “What is the matter?” I said, “Don’t be worried. You know I am crazy – now I have gone completely crazy! I am laughing at myself. Don’t feel offended. Just go to sleep.”
#From Book -Theologia Mystica - Chapter 9: Transformation, Not Information.

Immediately after my enlightenment, I rushed to the village to meet two people: first, Magga Baba, the man I was talking about before. You will certainly wonder why.... Because I wanted somebody to say to me, ""You are enlightened."" I knew it, but I wanted to hear it from the outside too. Magga Baba was the only man I could ask at that time. I had heard that he had recently returned to the village.
I rushed to him. The village was two miles from the station. You cannot believe how I rushed to see him. I reached the neem tree....
I rushed to the neem tree where Magga Baba sat, and the moment he saw me do you know what he did? I could not believe it myself--he touched my feet and wept. I felt very embarrassed because a crowd had gathered and they all thought Magga Baba had now really gone mad. Up till then, he had been a little mad, but now he was totally gone, gone forever...gate, gate--gone, and gone forever. But Magga Baba laughed, and for the first time, in front of the people, he said to me, ""My boy, you have done it! But I knew that one day you would do it.""
I touched his feet. For the first time, he tried to prevent me from doing it, saying, ""No, no, don't touch my feet anymore.""
But I still touched them, even though he insisted. I didn't care and said, ""Shut up! You look after your business and let me do mine. If I am enlightened as you say, please don't prevent an enlightened man from touching your feet.""
He started laughing again and said, ""You rascal! You are enlightened, but still a rascal.""...
I then rushed to my home--that is, my Nani's home, not my father's--because she was the woman I wanted to tell what had happened. But strange are the ways of existence: she was standing at the door, looking at me, a little amazed. She said, ""What has happened to you? You are no longer the same."" She was not enlightened, but intelligent enough to see the difference in me.
I said, ""Yes, I am no longer the same, and I have come to share the experience that has happened to me.""
She said, ""Please, as far as I am concerned, always remain my Raja, my little child.""
So I didn't say anything to her. One day passed, then in the middle of the night, she woke me up. With tears in her eyes, she said, ""Forgive me. You are no longer the same. You may pretend but I can see through your pretense. There is no need to pretend. You can tell me what has happened to you. The child I used to know is dead, but someone far better and luminous has taken his place. I cannot call you my own anymore, but that does not matter. Now you will be able to be called by millions as theirs, and everybody will be able to feel you as his or hers. I withdraw my claim--but teach me also the way...
After my enlightenment, for exactly one thousand, three hundred and fifteen days* I tried to remain silent--as much as it was possible in those conditions. For a few things I had to speak, but my speaking was telegraphic.
The man who forced me to speak--for one thousand, three hundred and fifteen days I had remained silent--was very strange. He himself had remained silent his whole life. Nobody heard about him; nobody knew about him. And he was the most precious man I have come across in this or any of my lives in the past. His name was Magga Baba
He forced me to speak. He said, ""Look, I have remained silent my whole life, but they do not hear, they do not listen. They cannot understand it; it is beyond them. I have failed. I have not been able to convey what I have been carrying within me, and now there is not much time left for me. You are so young, you have a long life before you: please don't stop speaking. Start!""
Many people become enlightened, but not all of them become masters--for the simple reason that they are not articulate, they cannot convey what they feel, they cannot communicate what they have experienced. Now it was just accidental with me, and I think it must have been accidental with those few people who became masters, because there is no training course for it. And I can say it with certainty only about myself.

"What chakra of mine is blocked if I feel anxious, tensed, and depressed most times? How do I unblock chakras?","What chakra of mine is blocked if I feel anxious, tensed, and depressed most times?
When kundalini is awakened and it hovers over root chakra then it is said to have blocked at Sacral Hara Chakra.
Sacral Hara Chakra represents death and it is also connected to sexual pleasure*.
Death can be any of the below:-
Physical Death
( death threat)
Emotional death
(Break up or death of loved one or divorce)
Professional death
( Job uncertainty or financial survival crises)
Psychological death
( Ego is always under pressure of society for social approval).
Fear of any death causes uncertainty and that is the cause of anxiety.
How do I unblock chakras?
Your understanding that nothing is permanent in this world will bring a kind of balance in your life.
Your understanding that death will take away everything will give you a chance to enjoy the present.
Fear always happens in the absence of love and compassion. Like darkness is the absence of light - fear is the absence of love and compassion.
In short, all good that we know as humans springs out of our ability to love."
Why am I having vivid mental images shortly after falling asleep?,"This is because of fear of death. When energy gets stuck at Hara then you get vivid mental images just after falling asleep and you wake up scared. You get Heart palpitations.
You should learn to relax and understand the reason for fear.
Regular light exercise/workout will also help."
Why is meditation before sunrise considered good?,"There are 30 Mahurats of 48 minutes in a day and 1st and 2nd Mahurat called Brahm Mahurat. The first two mahurats are considered most auspicious for meditators (Sadhak).
At this time most meditators meditate throughout the world.
When you meditate at this time you get the benefits from these meditators.
Your meditation happens easily at this time.
How do you calculate Brahm Mahurat?
Let's take today's (11th Nov 2021) Sunrise at New Delhi: 6.41 am.
Now, 6.41 am - 96 minutes ( 48x2) = 5.05 am - this is the time the first Brahm Mahurat will start.
For second Brahm Mahurat = 5.05 am + 48 minutes= 5.53 am second Brahm Mahurat will start at 5.53 and will continue till 6.41 am.
All meditators who have experimented with meditation and Samadhi came to one conclusion - 48 minutes of meditation at first Brahm Mahurat is most rewarding for Sadhak.
Happy meditating!"
How much time per day is required in a state of meditation to achieve self-improvement?,"Don't make a goal of meditation. If you make a goal of meditation your ego will make it ambition and you will struggle to meditate, you will be frustrated.
Meditation is non-doing. Doing is a way of moving out. Non-doing is a way of moving into the centre of your being.
The trick to meditating is to become an observer of the mind. Meditation starts by being separate from the mind, by being a witness of the mind. e.g. When you look at the mirror, you will only see your face if there is a distance between your face and the mirror, if the mirror is too close to your face you won't be able to see your face. Likewise when you become observer/witness of mind then a gap is created between mind and witness/observer/watcher.
Watching is the key to meditation. Watch your mind. Don’t do anything – no repetition of mantra, no repetition of the name of god- As you watch, slowly mind becomes empty of thoughts; but you are not falling asleep, you are becoming more alert, more aware.
As the mind becomes empty. Just by watching, you immediately get out of the mind.
While witnessing there will be gaps between any two thoughts and as you keep meditating these gaps will become larger and larger and one fine day one of the gaps will become permanent. You will enter state of no-mind.
Permanent cessation of mind as master."
How does someone who remains in meditation permanently think since there is no talking to yourself in meditation?,"There are three states of the self-realised person.
Alpha State of mind is meditation with contents but there is no identification with thoughts.
Theta State of mind is meditation with rare insights which generally we consider as intuition.
Delta State of mind which is called waking-sleep, here the meditator doesn't have any thoughts - he is awake but he doesn't have contents ( not a single thought).
To think he will choose to shift to Alpha or Theta state of mind.
Delta state of mind also known as Turiya - the fourth - which is beyond states of human consciousness - waking, dreaming and sleeping.Here only the ‘isness' remains.
Turiyatita - here the thinker, thinking and thoughts all are merged into emptiness and ‘Isness' also dissolves. People in Turiyatita walk like a piece of sky walking on earth. These people are known as blue beings e.g. Shiva and Krishna. Mere presence of blue being uplifts the consciousness of the whole planet.

What is the argument for becoming enlightened instead of simply enjoying the illusion?,"Life is not an illusion. Life is as real as you are. The problem is your identification with body and mind.
Enlightenment enables you to know your true-self, which is not your body, which is not your emotions, which is not your thoughts and which is not even your mind.
You are beyond all that you know as ‘I', me and mine.
You are tabula rasa. You are eternal. You are beyond birth, life and death. You are immortal."
What should I do if I want to be loved by someone who doesn't find me good enough?,"Now, this is the problem of everybody who thinks he knows what love is.
You want approval from another person.
This is not love this is neediness.
Love is to give, not to take.
Love happens where ‘I' dissolves.
All that good we know as humans happen in a deep abode of surrender.
Love liberates.
Love doesn't possess.
Love says ‘Yes' when someone needs you.
Love says ‘No' when someone expects ‘Yes' out of greed.
Love is the flight from alone to alone.
Love means aloneness not loneliness.
Love makes you fly like a bird on the wing.
Love is always unconditional, otherwise, it is something else, not love."
I have schizophrenia and I don't want to take meds. Will meditation and exercise help me cope better without meds?,"All neurosis happen because of energy blockages in chakras.
Schizophrenia is a bit deeper mental problem. It belongs to psychic knots ( Granthis) of kundalini/Chakras.
The first problem people suffering from Schizophrenia face is the inability to enter meditation.
Every Schizophrenia patient needs a specific set of steps (therapy) to enter meditation.
Once the patient can meditate then the problem of Schizophrenia can be cured within a few months.
Light exercise and a balanced diet can be of great help."
Is meditation for weak minded people and any insecurity/ problem can be solved with determination?,"Meditation is for brave hearts. Meditation takes you into the unknown - The World you never know otherwise.
Those who dare to jump into uncharted waters can't be timid.
What is meditation?
Meditation is mean not the end.
Restlessness is the very nature of the mind. The mind can be anywhere but not here and now.
Meditation is something beyond the mind. Meditation can help you reduce your erratic thoughts. But still, thoughts will remain.
Meditation is one and crucial part of the inner work. Meditation alone can not ensure inner peace.
If meditation is making you a bit silent then meditation is not working on you.
Meditation should shake you, it should give you a dark night of the soul.
Inner peace can not be ascertained till your mind remains. It will be one day peaceful other day hell.
Inner alchemy happens when you attain no-mind.
I totally disagree with people who keep meditating for decades. They have not worked on inner transformation. They have missed the point.
The only purpose of meditation is to transcend meditation when your life becomes a meditation. You don't sit even for 5 minutes to attain inner peace. Inner peace prevails in every moment of life. Meditation happens in every moment of life.
Your walking is meditation, your eating is meditation and your sleeping is meditation. You become a meditation."
What is the difference between present awareness and enlightenment?,"What you know as awareness (before enlightenment) is actually a state of consciousness.
Consciousness = Conscious Mind + Aware(ness).
There is a subject (one who is conscious = mind's ‘I') and an object (one which is mind's ‘I' conscious about) in Consciousness.
Consciousness might not have an object but there will be a subject in all states of consciousness.
Awareness neither has object nor subject.
Awareness is ‘isness', which is beyond the states of human consciousness.
Awareness is the background that underlies and pervades the three common states of consciousness. The three common states of consciousness are: waking state, dreaming state, and dreamless deep sleep.
Whereas consciousness is manifested/embodied awareness as the mind's ‘I'."
I am so confused about the concept of meditation. Some say it is about stopping your thoughts. How can I not think about anything? Even thinking about not thinking makes me think even more.,"Mind is chaos, mind is noise because the mind is ‘doing'.
Meditation ( dhyana ) is ‘non-doing'.
Mind is to choose and meditation is about being ‘choiceless'.
You can't stop your mind PERIOD.
But you can transcend your mind altogether.
Yes, you heard it right. You can transcend your mind because meditation doesn't belong to the mind.
Meditation belongs to pure consciousness aka awareness.
How to transcend the mind?
Be a witness, let the thoughts come and go. Don't identify, don't cooperate, don't resist. By and by thoughts will become powerless.
When you witness your thoughts there will be gaps between the thoughts and that is where meditation happens.
And
When you keep meditating for years these gaps become longer and longer. If you keep it up - one fine day one of the gaps will become permanent. You will enter the state of no-mind permanently. One step more you will enter Samadhi.
Meditators who have experimented with Dhyana came to similar conclusions - if you can remain in meditation (gaps) for exactly 48 minutes you will enter no-mind.
If you remain in no-mind for 48 hours continuously then you will enter Turiya*.
If you remain in Turiya* for 13 days or more you will be rooted in Turiya*.
If you remain in Turiya* for more than 9 months you will enter Turiyatita**.

*Turiya - The fourth - the state of enlightenment -Turiya is the background that underlies and pervades the three common states of consciousness. The three common states of consciousness are: waking state, dreaming state, and dreamless deep sleep.
**Turiyatita - When that it is the fourth (witness behind three states) also disappears, Turiyatita happens. That is why the Self is described as beyond the fourth (Turiyatita).

"Having dived deep into non duality, I feel I have been left in the lurch with all my previous spiritual beliefs destroyed one one hand and not having awakened either… What do I do?","Non-duality is one of many aspects of spirituality.
I haven't seen anyone attaining spiritual awakening following non-duality.
The phrase non-duality is used to catch the essence of the unmanifested (pure consciousness). This is a stupid phrase much in misuse nowadays. Since it refers to the unmanifested, it is misleading, for there isn't even room for a negative in what is unmanifested. The unmanifested SELF ( pure consciousness) simply IS. This doesn't mean the phrase ‘I AM THAT' describes unmanifested any better than ‘I AM' (manifested SELF) , since there is no ‘I' in what is in unmanifested (pure consciousness).
Moreover, non-duality can't be approached directly. Our mind is a complex mechanism and anything that tries to muddle with the mind patterns* is directly taken for yet another ride to cause & effect and fiction.
The mind can only be influenced by indirect methods like stories, jokes, koans and riddles. Other way to influence the subconscious mind is hypnosis.
Never remain fool by believing there is any direct method like non-duality.
Someone who has merely learned to think and talk non-duality is not awakened or enlightened at all; in fact, he is a fraud misguiding sincere seekers.
Know your mind first then choose the path.
*Mechanism of mind by Edward De Bono."
Are our thoughts truly our own?,"Sometimes our thoughts are original and we perceive them as rare insights or intuition.
Thoughts that come based on the outer world are the thoughts influenced by others. These are the predictions based on intentions and expectations.
Thoughts that come from within are called intuition. Intuition is accurate because it doesn't depend on the outer world. It comes from the absolute truth.
Absolute reality is where the fiction of your mind doesn't exist."
Is a kundalini awakening a lifeshattering event?,"Kundalini awakening is a transmutational event.
All you ever thought yourself to be, is shattered and you embrace your infinite self.
There are millions of people experience spontaneous kundalini awakening, but they remain restricted to spiritual experiences (out of ignorance or ego), whereas they fail to understand that kundalini awakening brings them their true nature - which is beyond body and mind.
Kundalini awakening should not be treated as something supernatural, it is divine grace and one of the way to tell you that existence saves.

Out of 45 minutes of meditation, your meditation happens a few minutes because meditation happens when your mind is not otherwise you keep pulling your mind to meditation most of the time.
Getting into meditation at least takes 10–20 minutes but you will halt before the meditation part will happen.
It is okay if you want to practice mindfulness."
Is it possible for someone to have a 2nd spiritual awakening? How many spiritual awakenings can a person have?,"There can only be only one spiritual awakening.
There can be many levels of consciousness also known as chakras.
And
There is a phase of grounding also after a spiritual awakening.
What seems like many awakening is actually because of an initial lack of groundwork.
In absence of a deep understanding of the nature of mind and energy, it is really difficult to come to terms with human psychology without knowing subtle body energy.
Spiritual awakening is always final there is no levels or stages or 1,2,3 awakening."
How come thoughts tend to come true? Is it intuition or just good prediction of how situations play out?,"Thoughts that come based on the outer world are the thoughts influenced by others. These are the predictions based on intentions and expectations.
Thoughts that come from within are called intuition. Intuition is accurate because it doesn't depend on the outer world. It comes from the absolute truth.
Absolute reality is where the fiction of your mind doesn't exist."
Is block and close is same in chakra? Does close chakra give problem like block chakra (remember chakra can be close)? It said by researcher and chakra teacher.,"Block chakra and close chakra are two entirely different states.
Close Chakra :-
When the kundalini is dormant that means kundalini is sleeping in Kunda then every chakra represents material aspect of chakras. This is said to be closed chakras.
Blocked Chakra:-
When the kundalini is active and energy is blocked in one of upper six chakras above Muladhar/ Root Chakra, then chakra is said to be blocked. Blockage of chakra represents spiritual aspect of chakras (kundalini)."
Can meditation help you get rid of brain fog?,"The ‘Brain Fog' is also known as ‘Scattered Brain' and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) it is caused by an imbalance in the brain’s most crucial chemicals: serotonin, dopamine, and cortisol.
And
Rebalancing these three brain chemicals will enable the rest of your brain’s chemistry to reach optimal levels.
To cure the brain fog one has to take the whole person into account and approach the problem from all aspects of life.
Now the meditation part:-
‘Brain Fog' or ‘Scattered brain causes a continuous stream of thoughts, jumping from one thought to another; it is like a flux.
First of all, you have to break the stream of thoughts by improving your concentration.
What is concentration?
Fixing your whole consciousness on one object, not allowing the object to disappear, bringing, again and again, your consciousness on the object so that the unconscious habit of the mind of continuous flux can be dropped; because once the habit of continuous change can be dropped, you attain to integrity or crystallization.
Concentration means bringing your consciousness to one object and becoming capable of retaining it there –on one object.
You can improve your concentration by carefully selecting the object of concentration.
The object of concentration can be either of the following:-
Image of God you believe in.
Sound of the running water.
The chirping of the birds.
Anything you feel comfortable to concentrate on.
Let the thoughts and feelings come, don’t try to suppress them. Don’t fight the mind. Let the thoughts come, observe them, gently return to the object of concentration. You can also mentally name any distraction as noise, noise, noise.
When you concentrate completely you become absorbed into your object of concentration, you become purely receptive.
Meditation is the second step. Once you can concentrate for a longer duration then you can start meditation. In meditation, consciousness is important; you have to make consciousness a continuous flow.
Just sit and witness your thoughts, let the thoughts come. Don’t give energy to thoughts. Don't cooperate. Slowly thoughts will become powerless. Let the thoughts come, notice and let them go.
In addition to that, you will have to work on your inner dialogues also (to spare pranic energy for meditation) by understanding the futility of your negative feelings.
You will have to include healthy eating habits avoiding alcohol, smoking. Include quality health supplements.
You should also include light workouts or yoga. The light workout will help you sleep as sleep is important to restore optimum brain functioning.
Meditation is not the solution. Meditation happens when you simplify your life.

What is the experience of oneness like? How can a non-enlightened person experience this state?,"There is no experience of oneness. There is no experiencer.
Mind is left behind in Samadhi - mind works like a camera at door. Anything that is known is inferences of mind when the Samadhi ends. Nobody can tell you exactly what happened in Samadhi, it's all inferences.
Samadhi is like a black hole where the concept of time and space ends and the reunion of the soul happens with the source."
Can we keep 2 Osho Zen tarot decks at home?,"Yes, but those zen cards are not for predictions.
Osho zen carrot cards are to formulate combinations of zen riddles or Koans to meditate on. In Zen tradition Riddles and Koans are used to break the thinking loops and the main purpose of Osho zen Cards is to attain Satori or spiritual awakening."
Does enlightenment increase your awareness level?,"The highest consciousness is cosmic consciousness.
When awareness moves deeper then Consciousness moves to superconsciousness and finally to cosmic consciousness.
It happens like this when your awareness goes to subconscious mind -> unconscious mind -> collective unconscious mind -> cosmic unconscious mind simultaneously your consciousness moves to superconsciousness -> collective consciousness -> cosmic consciousness.

"What is the connection between aura, chakras, and kundalini?","Kundalini is the life force that travels through three main Nadis - Ida, Pingala and Sushumna and each Chakra is a vortex of swirling energy and energy emitting from top chakra called crown chakra. Every chakra in your physical body has corresponding points in your subtle body, and as you release and cleanse each Chakra your aura changes.
The opening of chakras happens in pairs - the first chakra is male and the second chakra is female (the third chakra is male and fourth is female and so on….) -
When the first chakra meets the second chakra your aura changes to fearlessness.
When the third chakra meets the fourth chakra your aura changes to love and compassion.
When the fifth chakra meets the sixth chakra your aura changes to the divine.
When the seventh chakra meets eight chakra your aura range changes to 4–5 km.
When the 9th chakra opens your words carry Godliness."
What’s the best way to get over someone you love?,"Love grows out of freedom.
Love doesn't possess.
Love says ‘Yes' when someone needs you.
Love says ‘No' when someone expects ‘Yes' out of greed.
Love is the flight from alone to alone.
Love means aloneness , not loneliness.
Love makes you fly like a bird on the wing.
Love is always unconditional, otherwise, it is something else, not love. Unconditional means no attachment."
Yesterday while I was meditating listening to a third eye opening binuaral beat I saw a purple color light inside my eye.Is my third eye opening?,"Your kundalini is awakened and energy (prana) has stuck in the second chakra.
When energy is stuck at the second chakra you will see solid colours without shapes and you will also smell a strange fragrance from inside.
To move to the higher chakra you will have to practice forgiveness, gratitude and surrender which can be equivalent to devotion."
What is love in its purest form?,"Love grows out of freedom.
Love doesn't possess.
Love says ‘Yes' when someone needs you.
Love says ‘No' when someone expects ‘Yes' out of greed.
Love is the flight from alone to alone.
Love makes you fly like a bird on the wing.
Love is always pure, otherwise, it is something else not love."
How has astrology changed your life?,"Astrology is the fiction of mind it comes from the same place where ‘Alice and wonderland' is written.
I mean ‘fiction' with numbers and stars.
Astrology, numerology and Tarot Cards all are mind munching exercises.
Ask Mark Zuckerberg - Do you believe in astrology?
Ask Jeff Bezos - Do you believe in Tarot cards?
Ask Ratan Tata - Do you believe in numerology?
The answer will be “Cazzette”.
It is an Italian word."
Are enlightened beings always conscious?,"Always, even while they sleep.
Enlightenment means living now and here like there is no past or future.
Time is a human concept actually there is no time, birds don't have a wristwatch.
They sleep when the sun goes down and they wake up when the sun comes up.
They just take what they need and they don't hoard, because they don't know - what is future.
There is no past or future and no present also. The moment you say 12.31 pm it's already 12.32 pm. There is eternity only where you just live here and now.
BECAUSE life happens here and now."
"Despite all the Buddhist discussion about enlightenment, where do we find in any recent times that anyone in any Buddhist sect has met the criteria empirically to be considered enlightened?","Religion is conditioning whether it's Hinduism, Buddhism or Christianity.
Though Buddhism and Jainism are the religion of enlightenment but ironically religion itself becomes a hurdle to enlightenment.
No Buddhist, No Hindu and No Jaina can attain enlightenment. Only Tabula Rasa can attain enlightenment. This is the very nature of the enlightenment, it requires one to transcend all dogmas no matter how beautifully it is crafted.
That is why enlightenment is as rare as Buddha and Krishna."
"I don't believe in God anymore. I don’t know why, now I just believe that there are good and bad energies and spirituality and that's it. Is it bad that I stopped believing in God?","I don't believe in God anymore.
There is no God so it hardly matters you believe it or not.
Now I just believe that there are good and bad energies and spirituality and that's it.
You have just changed the name of God to good energy. God is the good devil and the devil is a bad God. You are still stuck in the same old duality of mind.
Is it bad that I stopped believing in God?
Not at all. Get it straight - There is no God.
This part of your question is a reflection of your fear that always needs God as your saviour and disbelieving is also believing something, you remain related to God.
Godliness resides beyond the duality of good and bad, believing and disbelieving, God and the devil."
"Is there anything called as dark side of spiritual awakening? If so, how could one rectify oneself from the same?","Absolutely Yes,
One who suffers is ego only, otherwise, there is no suffering. To put an end to suffering the crucifixion of the ego is a ‘must' PERIOD.
Death of ‘ego' is not something one can understand intellectually but one thing is sure labour pain has to be endured to be born again. You have to carry your Cross.
No child has come into this world without the pain and spiritual awakening is much greater happening than physical birth, spiritual birth is more painful than physical birth. It is a journey from body to soul.
That is what Jesus meant by - Death and Ressurection.
The death of ego (mind's ‘I') and resurrection of ego happens on spiritual awakening- new ego is saintly and void of negative human traits.
But before spiritual awakening life becomes meaningless. You completely lose yourself. You won't look the same.
This is one of the stages of spiritual awakening known as CHAOS of Life and doctors call it depression, Acute stress disorder (ASD) ,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), ‘Brain Fog', ‘Scattered Brain' and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).
Though you can't acknowledge the stages of awakening but the day you come to know about ‘Dark Night of the Soul’ the perceptions of your dilemma change and that gives you a new direction.
There is a universal law:- The moment you become aware of something you become the controller of it otherwise you remain a victim.
This stage is primarily called CHAOS when Life shakes you with the death of a loved one or divorce or breakup, then “Goodbye” is hardest word to say and you fall to CHAOS, where you try to disidentify from what people know as ‘LIFE' or you tend to lose all your emotions.The meaning of life is changing. The meaning of relations is changing. The meaning of your identity is changing.Your emotions are freezing.You will come to this stage many times in your life but never bother to transcend this stage and you decide to remain in your comfort zone.
Warning: Here you can become a VICTIM of TWIN-FLAME and Tantra Groups.If you remain aware you transcend to the NEXT stage DEATH.
————STAGE DEATH———————This Stage is the most difficult one and it can last for months or years or maybe you never transcend this stage. Doctors call it Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD).
*—Dark Night of the Soul —*
The first time it was mentioned as ‘Dark Night of the Soul’ by 16th-century Spanish mystic St. John of the Cross in his poem.You have become emotionless and immune to life and its absurdities. You become non-being.You will have many COMPLEX-PTSD attacks during this stage due to Near Death Experiences (NDE) because of one last attachment or desire.
‘EGO' is fighting with soul one last time. This is the final showdown. The soul is just trying to show the way to ‘ego'.If you just listen to your soul. The soul will lead you like a guiding angel. Some call it spirit guide, I call it wisdom of the soul.Your soul wants to be liberated and your ego wants to run its show who wins this is a matter of awareness and surrender.
Now it is time for ‘ego' to go.Here master can be helpful.If you remain aware and you surrender to the soul:-At this stage, DEATH of the ego happens and there should be someone to bear labour pain and the master becomes WOMB to ‘new you’, then you transcend to the next stage LIFE. (this stage is also called heart chakra blockage).
——————STAGE LIFE ——————-OLD ‘ego' is gone now new Life will have a new set of rules. This is the new dawn and the new world because at this stage your Third eye is already opened. You are renewed, resurrected.
Life is beautiful.
This is the stage of self-realization.
Now you have a choice:-You can become Epicurus or Buddha if you remain aware, both are beautiful. This is where one leads authentic life. You enjoy every minute of your life. Neither Life nor death can shake you. This is what I call ‘immortal', you have become Immortal.
From here MASTER can't help you. You will be guided by your wisdom which can lead you to NEXT STAGE -BLISS.
—————-STAGE BLISS———————This STAGE is called BLISS or Buddha-hood. If you come to this STAGE by denying material life then you have the possibility of becoming BUDDHA- full of pure love and awareness.

"There is a blissful feeling in the middle of my forehead during meditation, would this have anything to do with an opening of the third eye?","Not exactly but it has something to do with your heart chakra. Your heart chakra has opened and now your kundalini is balanced.
The heart chakra is the middle of the 7 chakras system. Three chakras are below the heart chakra and three chakras are above the heart chakra.
Root Chakra, Sacral Hara Chakra and Solar Plexus are below heart chakra and these chakras belong to material life.
Throat Chakra, Third eye and Crown chakra are above heart chakra and these chakras belong to spiritual life.
Now you will live a balanced life with compassion and love for everyone."
Is intelligence related in any way with spirituality? Are scientists therefore more or less likely to be spiritual?,"Only an intelligent person can be spiritual. But intelligence should have innocence in it.
If intelligence is because of cunningness to appear know-it-all then it is a game of ego - finding its ground.
The intelligence of a child is innocent and you can see it in his very act of examining things and learning things.
Innocence should be an integral part of any spiritual endeavours. Intelligence is needed to understand and reflect on the insights one gets during the spiritual journey.
The keys to a meaningful spiritual journey are intelligence and innocence."
Can spirituality and intellect go together? Are spirituality and intelligence at odds with each other?,"Only an intelligent person can be spiritual. But intelligence should have innocence in it.

The intelligence of a child is innocent and you can see it in his very act of examining things and learning things.

The keys to a meaningful spiritual journey are intelligence and innocence."
"For almost 1 year, I see two eyes looking at me when I close my eyes. I think I have been possessed by a ghost or something supernatural. Do you know something about it?","You are stuck at the second layer of reality because of the blockage at your second chakra.
The second chakra (Sacral Hara Chakra) is related to death, ghosts and Gods.
To overcome this you have to transcend the second chakra and reach the balance at the heart chakra.
If you practice forgiveness, gratitude and compassion you will be free of this energy blockage."
"Only frustrated, depressed, hopeless, and boring people can walk the spiritual path. Do you agree with the statement?","Every child is born either as Buddha or Krishna.
Both are facets of our life. Some will walk the path of Krishna and some will walk the path of Buddha.
But both will reach the same destination.
The path of devotion is the path of singing and dancing.
The path of Buddha is the path of meditation and silence.
Now what path you choose is not in your hand. It is a pure selection by birth.

How and why does ego death occur? I have completely lost myself. I no longer look as I used to and I have no purpose and no awareness of myself.,"Death of ego is a psychological death or death of the conscious mind.
The death of ego (mind's ‘I') and resurrection of ego happens on enlightenment - new ego is saintly and void of negative human traits.

"Does Kundalini awakening happen during sadhana/meditation, or can it happen anywhere anytime?","Kundalini awakening happens in near-death experiences( NDE).
NOW, death can be any of the following:-
Emotional death
Professional death
Psychological death
Emotional death happens when near one dies or break up happens like divorce.
Professional death happens when you don't see any light in your profession as it happened to many in lockdown.
Psychological death is the result of the above two and it is called a spiritual awakening.
In a spiritual awakening, kundalini is awakened and it travels to upper chakras opening all chakras on the way.
And
It can happen anytime but it will happen while your mind and body will be at rest, not in a hectic daily life."
"When someone really wants to believe in God but just can't, what is the main cause/reason for this?","When someone really wants to believe in God but just can't, what is the main cause/reason for this?
His common sense is working fine. He is practical. We all know from the inside that there is no God Or God is an experience like love is an experience.
He wants to believe in God out of fear. In fact, God is the name of fear.
Man created God out of fear - fear of death.
All religions were created by humans because of fear of death.
Religion and God are the articulated work of primitive minds - a wooden leg.
God is a problem, not solution.
Throw that God out and know your true-self.
Edit: Remember I am saying - “Search and find out”. By killing your God I want to kill your Ghosts - God is positive Devil and devil is negative God. Both belong to the same plane of reality."
"Is trying to understand consciousness, a kind of halting problem, consciousness trying to understand its own working?","This is the beauty of human consciousness - it can go inward and understand itself.
No other organism has this ability.
Understanding his own consciousness is the greatest quest to understand the journey of the soul.
Otherwise, people are born and they die like animals.
What good is it to reach the moon? - the moon is a barren place, an ugly place. What good is it to reach mars?- Mars is a lifeless planet.
The greatest and boldest move is to accept the challenge to know thyself.
One who reached can only sing the song in bliss, he can't give it you - You have to seek to reach, there is no other option."
"In Islam do I have to love my mother or father if they look down on me and laugh at my face and flaws and think they look better than me? I don't feel like I love them anymore like I use to because of them looking down on me, I hate them for doing so","In any religion, just understand one thing - your father and mother are unconscious.
The very act you described is proof of that.
How can one find flaws in his/her creation?
They are sleeping like any other human. If you start hating them you will also become unconscious in hatred.
Let them realise whatsoever they are doing.
Thank them and convey the message to them - I know your problem!
We all should forgive the very act of finding flaws in physical appearance.
Because you are not your body, you are beyond your face.
Find your face that was before your birth and find that what will remain after your death. You are eternal. Find your true-self."
How should I cure myself of ego?,"You can't lose your ego PERIOD.
You can only surrender ego (false self) so that it can dissolve into a bigger better self.
It happens like this you want to break free from your crippled mind (ego). You find someone as a master with a more understanding and compassionate self. You learn from him the art of compassionate living and one fine day your false self (ego) dissolves into the master.
You become a clone of your master ( in terms of life and living).
But before you surrender your false self (ego) you need a crystallised ego. The crippled ego can't even surrender also it will remain confused about whether to surrender or not.
You need crystallisation of ego - a well-defined ego of a lion and tiger."
Can an animal get enlightened?,"Trees, birds, animals and the whole universe is already enlightened. They don't have any other way of being.
Only humans are not enlightened because they have free will. Humans can become animals and divine also. Assassins and rapists are examples of becoming animals. Whereas Krishna, Jesus, Buddha are the example of humans becoming divine.
Every human being on earth is potentially enlightened and enlightenment is a journey from false to truth, from darkness to light.
Enlightenment of animals and birds is unconscious and it is like enlightenment of kids. They are awake but they are unconscious, whereas enlightenment of humans is conscious.
Like the madness of mad is unconscious, whereas madness of enlightened beings is conscious.
An enlightened being is consciously mad."
"What is the difference between awakening, realisation and enlightenment?","It is said that seven days after his enlightenment the Buddha was passing by a man on the road who was struck by the radiance of his face and his peaceful presence.
The man stopped and asked, “ my friend, who are you? Are you some angel or God?”
“No,” said the Buddha.
“Well, then, are you some kind of magician?”
Again Buddha answered, “No.”
“Are you a celestial being? “
“No.”
“Well, then what are you ?”
The Buddha replied, “I am awake.”
Buddha means “the one who has awakened from duality”- self-realised.
Awakening and self-realisation are the same things.
The difference between self-realisation and enlightenment:-
What you know as ‘I' is the mind's ‘I'.
There is false-self as an ‘EGO'. There is duality. There is subject and object also.
When duality of mind's ‘I’ dissolves - it is called self-realisation.
When dewdrop realises itself, it is self-realisation.
When existence merges into your being that is called enlightenment.
When Ocean merges into dewdrop, it is called enlightenment.
In other words - when the sixth chakra(Agya/Ajna chakra) opens then you realise your nondual self and that is called self-realisation and when the 7th - Sahasrara Chakra + 8th-Bindu Chakra and 9th -Talu chakra open then it is called enlightenment.

How does one become an expert at meditation?,"Meditation is a mean not the end.
Restlessness is the very nature of the mind. Mind can be anywhere but not in present.
Meditation is something beyond mind. Meditation can help you reduce your erratic thoughts. But still, thoughts will remain.
Meditation is one and crucial part of the inner work. Meditation alone can not ensure inner peace.
If meditation is making you a bit silent then meditation is not working on you.
Meditation should shake you, it should give you a dark night of the soul.
Inner peace can not be ascertained till your mind remains. It will be one day peaceful other day hell. Mind is a noise.
Inner alchemy happens when you attain no-mind.
I totally disagree with people who keep meditating for decades. They have not worked on inner transformation. They have missed the point.
The only purpose of meditation is to transcend meditation when your life becomes a meditation. You don't sit even for 5 minutes to attain inner peace. Inner peace prevails in every moment of life. Meditation happens in every moment of life.
Your walking is meditation, your eating is meditation and your sleeping is meditation. You become a meditation.
Enlightenment is the culmination of meditation."
Which type of meditation is good to get rid of brain fog?,"The ‘Brain Fog' is also known as ‘Scattered Brain' and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) it is caused by an imbalance in the brain’s most crucial chemicals: serotonin, dopamine, and cortisol.
And
Rebalancing these three brain chemicals will enable the rest of your brain’s chemistry to reach optimal levels.

You can improve your concentration by carefully selecting the object of concentration.

The chirping of the birds.
Anything you feel comfortable to concentrate on.

What happens if I do meditation for 5 hours a day for a month?,"Your understanding of meditation is flawed.
Mind is ‘doing'. Meditation is ‘non-doing'.
How can you do ‘non-doing' for 5 hours?
Meditation means nothing to do and nowhere to go.
Just be……….here and now.
Whenever you think in terms of doing, doing meditation for x hours and x months, mediation becomes absurd.
Our mind is full of noise or our mind is noise because the mind is ‘doing'.
The mind fills its emptiness by thousand and one thing we know as ‘LIFE'. The mind keeps emptying and filling. Filling and emptying is the nature of mind.
Beyond the mind there is emptiness.
Only by non-doing, you can reach emptiness and emptiness is silence, stillness and peace.

Why is it so easy for enlightened beings to let go of the fear of their own physical death or their suffering/attachment of losing a loved one?,"One can't die twice. When the death of ‘ego' (mind's ‘I' construct) happens then one attains enlightenment.
The very transcendence of ego (mind's ‘I') renders one to dis-identify from all that we know as emotions. He knows he is not his body, he is not his emotions and he is not even his mind. Now there is nothing to be afraid of.
In the absence of ego ( mind's ‘I') the understanding arises - the understanding which comes out of his non-being.
Positive and negative emotions are two ends of the duality and enlightened being lives beyond these two ends.
And
Beyond these two ends of the worldly affairs, godliness breathes - enlightened being lives out of that godliness."
"Is it enough to see that the ego is a thought construct and not actually real? Or does the ego have to completely disappear (by grace), in order for Consciousness to recognize itself?","Ego is an inflated or deflated state of mind's ‘I' or separate-self.
This separate-self is essentially the mind's construct of ‘I'.
By no means the mind's ‘I' is an illusion rather it is a subset of the possible larger than this.
If a frog always remained in a water well that doesn't mean the ocean doesn't exist and if a frog comes to know the ocean, doesn't mean water well is false.
Both are real likewise it is about the expansion of human consciousness to the maximum.
Does the ego have to completely disappear (by grace), in order for Consciousness to recognize itself?
The ego never dies or rather it is about dis-identification from the ego(separate-self, mind's ‘I') that is what happens by grace and you become an observer of your ego."
"If some yogis claim to have seen God after enlightenment, then why don't they show some proof to the ignorant minds of the world? We only read stories, even about the recent greats such as Swami Vivekananda, but there are no evidences. Why?","God is an experience and interpretation of that experience is totally personal.
Path of devotion is full of imaginations. If you continuously go on insisting on a certain hypothetical concept of God, one day you will see that hypothesis becoming a reality.
Christian can't see Krishna. Mohammedan can't see Jesus and likewise Hindu can't see Jesus. They all can see what they believe in what is their hypothesis.
God is nothing but pure imagination. Enlightenment happens by dropping the concept of God. Very few people could do that and very few people become enlightened.
That is how Bhakti Marg works, you drop the last rope which is keeping you clinging to illusionary world called Maya.This is the last step to liberation. The only hook remaining, this is where most people fail.
Buddha said, “ If you meet Buddha on the way, just kill him.”
God is the imagination (Maya) and until you destroy that you won't break out of illusion (Maya). God is a subtle hook of Maya.
Here’s real story about Sri Ramakrishna and Mother Kaali:-
Ramakrishna was a devotee of the Mother Goddess of Calcutta.
An enlightened man, Totapuri, was just passing by. He looked at Ramakrishna and he felt great compassion for the fellow. He told Ramakrishna:
“You think that you have experienced the Mother Goddess.”
Ramakrishna said: “See, I have talked with her, and not one day, but every day.” He was an honest man, and what he was saying was true.
Totapuri laughed and he said: “Listen, that Mother Goddess is nothing but pure imagination. Unless you drop that you will never become enlightened. So sit down. I will remain here for three or four days, just for you. I have to help you in somehow dropping the Mother Goddess.”
Now that was a very difficult matter. Ramakrishna had loved the Mother Goddess his whole life, danced before her. He used to prepare food for her, He used to fight with the Mother Goddess. And he was not a traditional fellow; he was very untraditional, very loving, very innocent. His imagination of Mother Goddess was so real. Nobody could understand him.
Totapuri said to Ramakrishna: “You sit in silence.
You don’t have any other ropes (hooks) that I can see, just this one rope. So when you see the Mother Goddess arising in your imagination, just take the sword and cut the mother in two pieces. They will fall, and with them will fall the last barrier.”
Ramakrishna said: “From where am I going to get the sword?”
Totapuri said: “From where have you got this Mother Goddess? — From the same place. It is your imagination. That is also your imagination; only imagination is needed to cut imagination.”
It took three days because he would go into meditation and the Mother Goddess would be standing there, and he would forget all about Totapuri. He would forget all about the sword, and tears would star flowing from his eyes, and Totapuri would shake him saying: “What are you doing?”
Ramakrishna said: “What to do? — Because once I see her, she is so beautiful…. Don’t force me to cut her.”
Totapuri said: “Listen, I can see even from the outside:
your face immediately changes when you see the mother. I have brought a piece of glass, and the moment I see that you are seeing the mother —because your tears start flowing, your face becomes so beautiful — I will make the cut on your third eye centre with the glass. I have to do this because tomorrow I leave. I cannot waste any more time. This is the last chance: either you do it or I am finished with you.”
And Totapuri said: “When I cut your forehead and blood starts flowing, don’t hesitate, just take the sword and cut the mother.”
Ramakrishna cut the mother and he remained silent for six days. Totapuri remained for six days, and when Ramakrishna opened his eyes he thanked Totapuri and said: “If you had not come, I would have lived my whole life with the hallucination. My last barrier has fallen away.”
Ramakrishna became enlightened after he had cut the last barrier."
To what extent have you discovered evidence of a “rebirth” or a ‘new age’?,"You have to pay for the karma of your past lives………………..
By Past lives, I mean lives of your ancestors you get karma of them in your DNA.
By next birth, I mean your sons and grandsons, your daughters and granddaughters and so on.
The soul is your subconscious mind+ unconscious mind + collective unconscious mind and cosmic unconscious mind.
That is what soul is and the soul you get as your DNA."
"Whenever I meditate, I constantly get this thought of hurting someone who has done something cruel to my family. How do I deal with that in meditation?","Let's get it straight this is not a thought, it is a feeling, an emotion of revenge towards the person which is causing stream of thoughts, jumping from one thought to another; it is like a flux.
First of all, you have to break the stream of thoughts by improving your concentration.
What is concentration?
Fixing your whole consciousness on one object, not allowing the object to disappear, bringing, again and again, your consciousness on the object so that the unconscious habit of the mind of continuous flux can be dropped; because once the habit of continuous change can be dropped, you attain to integrity or crystallization.
Concentration means bringing your consciousness to one object and becoming capable of retaining it there –on one object.
You can improve your concentration by carefully selecting the object of concentration.
Object of concentration can be either of the following:-
Image of God you believe in.
Sound of the running water.
Chirping of the birds.
Anything you feel comfortable to concentrate on.
Let the thoughts and feelings come, don’t try to suppress them. Don’t fight the mind. Let the thoughts come, observe them, gently return to the object of concentration. You can also mentally name any distraction as noise, noise, noise.
When you concentrate completely you become absorbed into your object of concentration, you become purely receptive.
Meditation is the second step. Once you are able to concentrate for longer duration then you can start meditation. In meditation, consciousness is important; you have to make consciousness a continuous flow.
Just sit and witness your thoughts, let the thoughts come. Don’t give energy to thoughts. Don't cooperate. Slowly thoughts will become powerless. Let the thoughts come, notice and let them go.
In addition to that you will have to work on your inner dialogues also (to spare pranic energy for meditation) by understanding futility of your feeling of revenge.
Understand this:-
Best revenge of all is SUCCESS.
And remember you will not succeed if you remain stuck to that person.
Is he the center of your world?
You remain a prisoner of that person regardless of what you think or feel about him.
Real freedom from the person happens when his presence doesn't move you either way. When you are not concerned about his good or bad, success or failure.
Meditation is not the solution. Meditation happens when you simplify your life. When you know the value of silence."
Will it be okay if I only open the first 5 chakras and leave my third eye and crown chakra closed?,"Chakra opening and closing is not like switching on and off buttons.
Anything that is powerful is also most dangerous. You are going to play with the most mystical energy of the universe. You are going to play with the creator of this universe - kundalini - the cosmic energy - atomic energy.
Everyday I get enquiries of weird experiences of ghosts and spirits.
Don't worry it is not in your hands to awaken kundalini and it won't be in your hand to stop it either, once the serpent will hiss."
"If you said there is no rebirth of the soul, then what happens to our karmas of the present life?","Your karma is carried forward to the next birth…………………
By next birth, I mean your sons and grandsons, your daughters and granddaughters and so on.
‘Past lives' means lives of your ancestors you get karma of them in your DNA.
The soul is your subconscious mind+ unconscious mind + collective unconscious mind and cosmic unconscious mind.
That is what soul is and soul you get as your DNA."
What will happen if a butcher does meditation?,"Butcher may get enlightened as he is close to death, in fact, he is death himself.
What else can cause enlightenment? YES, we get glimpse of divine in death only and that causes the seeking in us.
There are many instances when a butcher got enlightened after massacring thousands of animals.
It is the realisation of that I am killing myself as I am killing life only that gets one started on the path of realisation of divine.
Wazid was hunting in jungle. When Wazid was about to release an arrow from the bow to kill the Antelope, the very jump of the Antelope stirred the insight like sudden clash of thunder that the life that is ruining in me is the same life running in the Antelope.
How can I kill myself?
And tears started rolling down his cheeks. Wazid broke the bow and arrow and threw them away.
He started to look for the God and he was a Muslim - Pathan -very simple at heart when he met his Master Dadu Dayal - Wazid never returned home, he returned to himself, it happens like that only one who seeks God, finds himself - true-self."
What's up with the ego of grownups (or at least parents)?,"Grownups are as unconscious as teenagers.
Most of the people don't grow beyond 14 years. They all have the same animalistic urges, emotional tantrums and more crystallised egos.
Go to any office and observe people you will see the strange tensed look on their faces and stoned eyes.
When I go into the market I get surprised looking at old men with eyes full of lust. I see old women trying to look younger than their daughters. People live life so unconsciously that they are not aware of the animal called ego.
There are three kinds of people:-
Those ignorant of the ego;
Those wanting and striving to overcome the ego;
and Those who know the ego and transcended the ego.
Age is hardly a criterion for egolessness.
My friend sent (while I was writing answer) me link to something related to ego:-

Will accessing the mental body give us knowledge about past lives?,"The physical body, Etheric body and Astral body all are combined on the mental body plane.
Thus the mental body does give access to past lives and this is where past life regression comes into the picture.
The astral body can only travel to past lives whereas the mental body can travel to the past and future also.
Other bodies are spiritual, cosmos and Nirvanic."
"If we take the statement ""I AM THAT"" as a core teaching of Advaita Vedanta, and the statement ""the ‘I’ IS NOTHING"" as a core teaching of Buddhism, are the two compatible, incompatible, or some 3rd option?","‘I AM THAT' is the initiation of the journey and ‘i is nothing' is the culmination of being everything.
‘I AM THAT' is going over the rainbow bridge and ‘i is nothing' is clear sunny sky and lush green meadow.
In ‘I AM THAT', ‘I' is an illusion and in ‘i is nothing' realisation of illusion.
Everybody who got enlightened had an uproarious laugh on enlightenment by realizing that there was nothing to attain, not a single person could hold his laughter at the ridiculousness of the whole quest. It was all about losing what one had as ‘I' - ‘I' was an illusion. This whole ruckus seems utterly meaningless on enlightenment.
Whether you follow ‘I AM THAT' or ‘i is nothing' you will reach nothingness or emptiness of ‘i' only. In the absence of ‘i' you become everything, you merge into the existence, you become whole.

How do I master ego?,"Ego is not the natural state of mind, it is a tense state of mind. It is an inflated or deflated state of mind.
It will always drive you away from your centre of being, natural being.
Ego is like shifting sands. At one time it is superman and at other times it is totally broken pieces of glass.
Now the real thing :-
How do I handle the ego?
You can't handle ego but you can dis-identify from your ego.
Be a witness of your ego. Witnessing will make you one step higher of your ego and that is how slowly slowly you will be able to subside your ego by dis-identifying from it.

Can you suggest me a spiritual book that can change my life?,"Are you looking for bullet points?
All the answers below and above my answer will give you the names of the books and masters but surprisingly, they are not realised yet.
The golden rule of self-realization is there is no rule, no method.
You can get enlightened while throwing sliced onion in hot olive oil or sesame oil in the pan and listening to the sizzling sound of tempering.
You can get enlightened watching the dry leaf falling from the tree.
You can get enlightened watching the last morning star setting.
And
In fact, it happened to Buddha, Lao Tzu and Sajarano.
Self-realization is the order of all the disorders."
"As a person, how do you value your soul?","The soul comes with every human and humans have a soul because humans have free will.
Rocks, trees, birds and animals can't have souls because they don't have any other ways to be. A lion will die as a lion only.
Only humans can choose to be devils and as well as divine. Rapists, extortionists and murderers are examples of humans becoming devils and whereas Krishna, Buddha and Jesus are examples of humans becoming divine.
It is a matter of realisation of the soul that is missing in most humans and before realisation of soul, it is just a concept or fiction."
"What is the point of saying we are all one One, if we don't actually feel or experience ourselves through another person's eyes? Doesn't this fundamental experience of duality disprove the claim that we are all one Being?","If the sun simply forgets one day to rise in the morning, you will be dead in few hours or days. We are connected even by sun rays, with the air every moment. If you don’t breathe you will die. We are deeply connected with everything else in millions of ways –that is the meaning of ecology - a system.
A man goes on saying ’I’. The ego is a declaration that ”I am separate from others, separate from the sky, trees and sea” –but are you separate? Are you really separate from others?
What makes you feel that you are separate?
It is very disorienting to feel that you are not the center of the world, that you are not the end and the purpose of the world, that the whole world has not been revolving around you. The ego gives you a rock to stand on, but the rock is imaginary.
You depend on air, water and food. How can you say you are not connected with the trees?
The idea of separateness is absurd. The idea of ‘I' as separate is absurd. It has no substance. It is made of the same stuff as dreams are made of.
The moment ‘I' is dropped, the whole becomes part of you. The ocean merges into the drop.

"Can you attain moksha by chanting any god, even Apollo?","Chanting Mantra works only with the first two chakras out of seven chakras.
Chanting Mantra can activate your Kundalini. Many people got activation of kundalini after chanting mantras for years.
Many people have asked me about the strange movement along their spine or at navel after chanting mantras for years.
Here is one of the answers you may find useful as reference:-

But higher chakras can't be activated by mantra chanting so Moksha by chanting mantras is next to impossible. Chanting mantras and not changing the other aspects of life can be counterproductive or may be dangerous at times.
This is the quality of Svadhisthana Chakra (Sacral Hara Chakra) to repeat one activity and that's why kundalini is activated by chanting mantras."
What is a spiritual awakening? What happens during it?,"What is darkness?
Absence of light.
Spiritual awakening means bringing the light in so that darkness doesn't remain. Awakening from the dream.
As you can't do anything to darkness directly but you can disperse the darkness by bringing the light similarly darkness of your mind (ignorance) can only be removed by the light of right knowing (mind you, I said ‘knowing', not knowledge).
This is what Buddha meant by saying “Appo Deepo Bhava”—'be your own light'.
How do we get to right knowing?
“Believe Nothing,
no matter
where you read it
or who has said it,
not even
if I have said it,
unless it agrees
with your own reason
and your
own common sense.” — Buddha.
Kabir explained the awakening in very simple terms. It is paraphrased as: “Just as the oil of the sesame is in the small sesame grain, just as the fire is there in the flint stone, so also is your divine, your divine in you. All you need is to awaken yourself.” That is: Be your own light.

How do you know you are going through spiritual awakening?,"No, you can't gauge your own spiritual awakening.
The moment you do that, it becomes - a dog chasing its tail -situation.
Though someone who has completed the journey can tell you about your stage of spiritual awakening with pretty good accuracy.
Spiritual awakening is expansion of consciousness and there are stages of spiritual awakening.
Now let's understand spiritual awakening.
The expansion of consciousness has three stages each stage supersedes the lower one.
Stage 1: When one comes to understanding the value of his/her life, the very first time his/ her consciousness turns inside and this insight gives the first lesson:-
“Your life is the most precious gift in this universe.”
Stage 2: When one comes to understanding the meaning of love. Love is not possessiveness. Love is not sex. Love is giving unconditionally.
“Love is about your inner state, it doesn't depend on the other person.”
Stage 3: When one comes to understanding that every positive comes with negative. When one transcends the duality of life.
You come to know the TRUTH - What is Truth? - “Truth is to see things as they are and live with them as they exist.”
You stop cursing life, you stop cursing God, you stop cursing yourself because now you know the meaning of life.
Your understanding of life is complete.
Life is bitter and sweat also, laughter and tears also. One who doesn’t know how to cry , he can’t know how to laugh. One who doesn’t enjoy laughter, his tears will be crocodile tears. You don't choose one thing against other anymore.
You learn the last lesson - Life is about ‘being’ not ‘living’.

"Between a war of ego versus a relationship, who always ends up being the loser and why?","In love loser is the winner. Now, this is a paradox, a riddle.
How can ‘defeat' be ‘win'?
If you always knew snatching and stealing you will not understand.
Whatever rules you know in life becomes futile in love and relationship.
Love has its own set of rules or rules of true love are opposite to what we know in life.
But one who really loved will know - How can defeat be a win?
One who loses all in love is the winner.

Is the death of your ego necessary for spiritual awakening?,"Absolutely Yes,
One who suffers is ego only, otherwise, there is no suffering. To put an end to suffering the crucifixion of the ego is a ‘must' PERIOD.
Death of ‘ego' is not something one can understand intellectually but one thing is sure labour pain has to be endured to be born again. You have to carry your Cross.
No child has come into this world without the pain and spiritual awakening is much greater happening than physical birth, spiritual birth is more painful than physical birth. It is a journey from body to soul.
That is what Jesus meant by - Death and Ressurection.

"I had an insight years ago that Consciousness/God was animating everyone's body, and everything is the ONE God. Why did I completely lose that insight if 'realization' is supposed to be permanent ?","This realization of God comes because of your egolessness in devotion to God.
Ego dissolves in love, devotion and compassion. You experienced the ultimate compassion towards life.
But somehow as it happens to most of us we have to return to daily life where we just have to run for money and goals. We seem to lose touch with our true-self, which is the source of all that good we know in our life.
Feel the love again and you will be back to the same good feeling of being one with the nature of God."
Are there any other ways to reach spiritual enlightenment besides meditation?,"The ultimate alchemy that happens on enlightenment has seeds in meditation.
We have three states of mind - waking, dreaming and sleeping. Fourth is not state it is our nature called Turiya. Turiya has something of waking and something of sleeping. Sleeping is not in the way we know. Sleeping means a state of no-mind.
What we know as witnessing in meditation is the seed of Turiya. Once you attain the state of no-mind permanently, one step more you enter Turiya and you start living in Turiya - The fourth - pure consciousness - a permanent state of bliss. Bliss - where all your questions become answers.
Meditation is a means to attain enlightenment.
Culmination of meditation is enlightenment."
Whose teachings would you rather follow and why? Lao Tzu and the Tao or The Buddha and the Dharma? Can they coexist?,"In fact, Zen is a combination of Taoism and Buddhism.
Taoism and Buddhism gel perfectly well.
Only the Koans and Riddles are originally added to teachings from Taoism and Buddhism to give birth to ZEN.
Zen appeals to the western world because of the non-existence of religious beliefs.
Zen consists of teachings from Taoism, Buddhism and Koans, Riddles and ZaZen as meditation.

Are OSHO’s views relevant today more than ever?,"Osho said many times during his discourses, “Whatsoever I am saying has been said before millions of times.”
He did add the new presentation to truth but whatsoever he said you will find in the words of Tantra, Advait, Neti Neti, Taoism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism, Sufism, Zen and Upanishads.
Most of his concepts and teachings are original as most of his teachings were derived from his direct experience of absolute truth. But to put it in understandable format he had to use the existing schools of thought.
His all teachings can be reduced to four points:-
Live here and now.
Replace your negative thoughts with positive thoughts or replace your negative emotions with positive emotions.
Doubt everything till you find something you can't doubt (Truth can't be otherwise).
Forego your ego.
*Don't forget his message of love and meditation.
Though, you will find many contradictions in his work but his work is relevant as it is rephrased truth.
In his book “From False to Truth”, he accepted the existence of contradictions but also pointed out the irrelevance of contradictions and mistakes.
“My old books are immensely important. Unless you understand them, you will not be able to understand me.
But remember, it is a constant flow and change, so don't be bothered with inconsistencies, contradictions.
If you go on, soon you will be able to find the truth. And once the truth is revealed, all contradictions and inconsistencies dissolve. Then you can see, crystal-clear, that it is a single message from the roots to the flower. It is a single organism.“ - From False to Truth- chapter 11:That explosion of bliss - Question 2."
"If Osho had a phototgraphic memory, why did he give wrong information which didn't happen in history?","People refer to infallibility of Osho by referring to photographic memory.
Photographic memory is nothing more than a fascination of human mind.
Osho made lot of mistakes and mixed up in many jokes during his discourses. You will find thousands of mistakes in his English and he accepted that gracefully by saying - English is not my mother tongue.
Below is example how gracefully Osho used to accept mistakes:-
The first question:
Osho,
There is something that even you cannot do. You can't put an Italian in an Irish joke. It is against the dharma.
It is true, I goofed again. Go on reminding me. These goddamned jokes are dangerous. And I love the Italians so much that wherever I can find a place for them I try to manage. Sometimes I succeed, sometimes I fail, but you caught me.
To put the record right, the joke is:
Two gentlemen are sitting in a garden, one British, one Irish.
The British gentleman asked the Irish, “If you were not Irish, what would you be?”
The Irish says, “Of course I would be British.”
And then he asks the British, “If you were not British, what would you be?”
And the British said, “I would be ashamed.”
But I got mixed up. That’s why I have all my jokes typed for me. That one was not typed for me. About God and about truth and about religion there is no trouble – I know them from my personal experience. But these jokes!
Yes, it is against the dharma. And I hope it is not going to happen again.

Names mix-up is the major problem of enlightened beings because of dis-identification from the name and ego.

Why is it that Osho Rajneesh is no longer relevant now?,"Thomas Thaliath,
Buddha said, “If you meet Buddha on the way, kill him.”
On the path of enlightenment, there is the time when only Osho is relevant and again there comes a time when only Osho is not relevant.“
The relationship between master and disciple is like a love affair or rather a spiritual love affair. All love and relations throw you back to the body but the love of the master will lead you beyond the body-mind and will help you experience the ultimate where you become pure bliss and complete in your aloneness.
There is a time to marry master in your life and then he becomes your only refuse still there is time to divorce him also and break away from the last attachment (hook) of this Maya.
Now everybody in the spiritual circle will be relevant to you like J. Krishna Murti, U.G. Krishna Murti, Raman Maharishi, Jaggi Vasudeva or Acharya Prashant except Osho.
[Remember this will happen many times during your journey.]
Everybody on the path of self-realization is on a different stage and medicine to one maybe poison to others.That is why I addressed this answer to you ( Thomas Thaliath) only because this answer can make sense to you only.
Ignore all advice and hate Osho like anything. Kick his books, throw his books into the fire like Osho burnt Rajneesh Bible -The Last Testament (the only religion in the world - ‘Rajneeshism' that died). Hate him like anything. Behave like a jilted lover. Let the ‘Osho inside of you’ know - You don't need him anymore, you will walk alone like a Lion.
Now it is time to be liberated from Osho also. It is time to say ‘GOODBYE' and never look back.

What attitude needs to be maintained for attaining spirituality?,"First, you have to understand and accept that you are a prisoner - a prisoner of concepts and belief systems.
I am Christan, Hindu or Muhammadan - this is religious prison.
I am democrat or Republican - this is political prison.
I am President of the United States - this is professional prison.
I am a Husband, lover or father - this is emotional prison.
Freedom comes beyond all that you think you are, when you come to know you are not your body, you are not your emotions and you are not even your mind.
Freedom comes when you reach your true self, which is eternal, which knows no death. Which is immortal."
What makes meditation easy or difficult for you?,"The mind is continuously jumping from one object to another. It goes on jumping. Your mind goes on constantly moving; it is like a flux.
These are the three stages of consciousness.
Concentration or contemplation – fixing your whole consciousness on one object, not allowing the object to disappear, bringing, again and again, your consciousness on the object so that the unconscious habit of the mind of continuous flux can be dropped; because once the habit of continuous change can be dropped, you attain to integrity or crystallisation.
There is Subject as You and Object as something you concentrate on.
So, concentration means bringing your consciousness to one object and becoming capable of retaining it there –on any object. Concentration and contemplation are the faculties of the conscious mind.
Dhyana (Witnessing) In Dhayan, meditation, consciousness is important; you have to make consciousness a continuous flow. The subject becomes important and the object becomes unimportant. Witnessing is the faculty of the subconscious mind.
Samadhi (non-doing), subject and object both are dropped and there remains only pure consciousness aka awareness. The duality dies in Samadhi.Non-doing is the faculty of the unconscious mind.
In concentration, there are many objects, many minds focussed and centred to one object.
In Dhayana there is one mind (subject) and no object.
In Samadhi there is no subject, no object and no mind (mind is the duality of subject and object, in absence of subject and object, it disappears) - only pure consciousness aka awareness remains.
These are three capabilities of mind (I prefer word ‘brain') which are used to attain Samadhi or deep meditation.
The reason for the difficulty in meditation is chakra imbalances.
If you are not able to concentrate then you will find difficult to meditate (Dhyana).
Balancing of chakra requires concentration and contemplation.
By balancing your chakras you enter meditation easily.
Heartfulness meditation tries to achieve this but it ignores the lower and upper chakras and it addresses only heart chakra. Heartfulness meditation works for few who live a very simplified life.
Chakra balancing uses four faculties of our consciousness by using chakra symbols - it addresses the colour and shapes, by Beej mantras it addresses the sound senses, by using mudras it addresses touch senses.
It is easy to enter deeper states of meditation like Alpha and Theta by balancing your chakras.

Why do highly spiritual people get diseases?,"Ramana Maharishi died of cancer because he had the habit of chewing betel leaves. Nisargadatta Maharaj used to smoke Bidi.
Enlightenment makes one vulnerable because of changes in physiology as the energy starts to travel upward the whole-body energy system changes.
Usually, the energy in the body travels downward to the sex centre (procreation) and that is how we live all our life but on enlightenment, the energy travels upward to the highest centre of our consciousness that is Sahasrara Chakra.
The gravity of the earth pulls the energy downward but on enlightenment, the energy(prana) is pulled upwards by the gravitational pull of the moon. After mergence with existence, you become an ocean, you become existence. It is unlikely that whatever affects existence like the moon, sun and all other planets will not affect you. Though they affect everybody but enlightened being notices them because of his expanded consciousness. He is well aware of the hidden mysteries of existence.
The energy is the same but the quality of energy changes to a lighter form. That is how some of enlightened beings could levitate and that is how Jesus could walk on the water.
Our lower body which is supposed to be strong becomes weaker with time after enlightenment. This may sound absurd but YES after enlightenment, one becomes weak physically.
One more factor that contributes to weakness is food - after enlightenment, one can't have a protein-based diet as that will hamper the upwards travel of the energy causing psychological problems and in the absence of protein body becomes weak.
And non-veg food becomes impossible to eat after enlightenment because that causes blockage in the heart chakra causing psychological problems like hallucinations and reality layers overlap. It is the purity of the body that doesn't allow one to even think of destroying any form of life.
With all goods, there is some bad news also but I want to make sure you should know the negatives of enlightenment before you take a plunge into uncharted waters.

Does spiritual awakening uncover the truth of everything?,"Before I answer ‘yes' or ‘no' you should understand the cause of limitations of mind.
Duality - Duality is the process of elimination of mind by choosing one over the other. This gives great power of concentration also. But you are limited to one side of the story.
Cause and effect - this is the great building block of our creation as newton said - every action has a reaction.
Fiction - the human mind is wired for stories and we all enjoy and get fascinated by stories. But this also takes us away from reality.
When the mind is unable to find the reason (cause) for the happening (effect) it gets confused and starts to make stories (fiction) by the process of choice and elimination (duality).
All this makes life untrue. Here people wander into fictions like twin flame, Angel guides, spirit guides, Siddhis, Tantra, Astrology, Tarot card, Goo-roos and what not? This is when people get exploited by conmen and charlatans.
If you go beyond the mind there is only truth - absolute truth, absolute reality.
Yes, spiritual awakening uncovers the truth of everything."
Did Osho have photographic memory?,"Photographic memory is nothing more than a fascination of human mind.
Osho made lot of mistakes and mixed up in many jokes during his discourses. You will find thousands of mistakes in his English and he accepted that gracefully by saying - English is not my mother tongue.
Below is example how gracefully Osho used to accept mistakes:-
The first question:
Osho,
There is something that even you cannot do. You can't put an Italian in an Irish joke. It is against the dharma.
It is true, I goofed again. Go on reminding me. These goddamned jokes are dangerous. And I love the Italians so much that wherever I can find a place for them I try to manage. Sometimes I succeed, sometimes I fail, but you caught me.
To put the record right, the joke is:
Two gentlemen are sitting in a garden, one British, one Irish.
The British gentleman asked the Irish, “If you were not Irish, what would you be?”
The Irish says, “Of course I would be British.”
And then he asks the British, “If you were not British, what would you be?”
And the British said, “I would be ashamed.”
But I got mixed up. That’s why I have all my jokes typed for me. That one was not typed for me. About God and about truth and about religion there is no trouble – I know them from my personal experience. But these jokes!
Yes, it is against the dharma. And I hope it is not going to happen again.
From The Dhammapada: The Way of the Buddha, Vol. 11, Chapter 4, Conscience Is a Strategy to Enslave You.
In his book “From False to Truth”, he accepted existence of contradictions but pointed out irrelevance of contradictions and mistakes.
“My old books are immensely important. Unless you understand them, you will not be able to understand me.
But remember, it is a constant flow and change, so don't be bothered with inconsistencies, contradictions.
If you go on, soon you will be able to find the truth. And once the truth is revealed, all contradictions and inconsistencies dissolve. Then you can see, crystal-clear, that it is a single message from the roots to the flower. It is a single organism.“ - From False to Truth- chapter 11:That explosion of bliss - Question 2.
Names mix-up is the major problem of enlightened beings because of dis-identification from the name and ego.
Enlightenment gives clarity because of absence of constructs like ‘cause and effect', non-duality, fictionlessness, not photographic memory.

"Which is better, realizing spiritual enlightenment or remaining immersed in the play of life? Can you explain your choice if both options seem to have their own unique advantages and disadvantages?","Enlightenment will naturally come to you if you flow with life.
Your ability to live life in totality is going to help you to have rare insights out of your ‘knowing'.
The seeking of Buddha started after he got bored of all that we know as luxuries of life.
Craving is something that keeps you clinging to the material world and transcendence of the cravings can only happen after living your life in totality.
The path of enlightenment passes through the door of life and while living life every surprise is a glimpse of enlightenment through the window of insight that opens inward.

Do all human beings have souls?,"The soul comes with every human and humans have a soul because humans have free will.
Rocks, trees, birds and animals can't have souls because they don't have any other ways to be. A lion will die as a lion only.
Only human can choose to be devils and as well as divine. Rapists, extortionists and murderers are examples of humans becoming devils and whereas Krishna, Buddha and Jesus are examples of humans becoming divine.
It is a matter of realisation of the soul that is missing in most humans."
"To be able to have a true spiritual awakening, do you think freedom is necessary?","Freedom is earned by attaining spiritual awakening otherwise freedom is just frivolous.
First, you have to understand and accept that you are a prisoner - a prisoner of concepts and belief systems.
I am Christan, Hindu or Muhammadan - this is religious prison.
I am democrat or Republican - this is political prison.
I am President of the United States - this is professional prison.
I am a Husband, lover or father - this is emotional prison.
Freedom comes beyond all that you think you are, when you come to know you are not your body, you are not your emotions and you are not even your mind.
Freedom comes when you reach your true self, which is eternal, which knows no death. Which is immortal."
Can you lose you spirtual awaking if so how can I get it back?,"Temporarily one can lose spiritual awakening by overstraining his mind with overthinking or doing complex calculations for a longer period of time without having enough rest or sleep.
But once you take enough rest you will regain the state of silence.
It happens to people who don't have knowledge about kundalini and chakra balancing.
Here are tips you may find useful:-
It takes time for one to readjust (grounding) to the new reality. There are subtle changes that happen to the brain especially just after spiritual awakening.
Before it becomes new normal there are few steps you have to take so that you avoid imbalances and breakdown.
Confusion happens when one has to pull some very old memories or one has to do complex calculations.
#1 Take a break from your job and if not possible try to take up light work or something you love to do.
#2 Try to remain in present (be an observer or witnessing) only.
#3 Meditate by witnessing twice a day.
#4 Always start your day with chakra balancing.
#5 Sleep for at least 8 hrs everyday
#6 Avoid alcohol.
There is very little you will find on the Grounding phase of spiritual awakening but grounding is the most important phase to stabilise and make the spiritual awakening permanent."
"Why do enlightened beings want to help others to become enlightened? What is the need for people who arrived home wants to change unreal, impermanent things like human emotions?","To share is to be human.

Are humans the only life form capable of enlightenment in this universe?,"Trees, birds, animals and the whole universe is already enlightened. They don't have another ways of being.
Only humans are not enlightened because they have free will. Humans can become animals and divine also. Assassins and rapists are examples of becoming animals. Whereas Krishna, Jesus, Buddha are the example of humans becoming divine.
Every human being on earth is potentially enlightened and enlightenment is a journey from false to truth, from darkness to light.
Enlightenment of animals and birds is unconscious and it is like enlightenment of kids. They are awake but they are unconscious, whereas enlightenment of humans is conscious."
Is the opposite of ego.. Ego?,"There is no opposite of ego. The ego is an artifact created by society to deceive you, to distract you.
To understand this let's understand:-
What is darkness?
Darkness is the absence of light. As such darkness has no existence. Light is not opposite of darkness rather darkness is absence of light.
Likewise, ego has no existence it is absence of right knowing. The ego is removed by bringing in the light of your being.
That's what Buddha meant by - Be your own light.
How do we get to right knowing?

Did any enlightened masters talk about what happens after enlightenment? What’s the next step? Or if they dissolve into nothingness and they become God consciousness watching the entire world within them?,"One enters on a rare pilgrimage after enlightenment.
I happened to read ‘The Ten Bulls of Zen' by Kakuan which is something unique in the history of human consciousness. Truth has been expressed in many ways, and it has always been found that it remains unexpressed whatsoever you do. It simply escapes description. The ‘Ten Bulls of Zen' by Kakuan have tried in a single effort to express the inexpressible.

The first eight bulls came from Taoism and two were added by Zen master Kakuan.
These two bulls represent the journey after enlightenment. The eighth bull represents enlightenment.
9th bull says ‘life is a goal'. Now one knows thoughts, dreams and reality are not different there is no distinction because no-mind can't distinguish.
You understand religion is mean not end. Religion is to make you happy not repressed. Happiness is Advaita- non-dual - your very nature. Your mind is misery and no-mind is peace. Life is only happiness. Happiness is climate.
Spread happiness by helping people to come out of mind. You have found new goal.
Tenth Bull:- (returning to society) I go to the market place again with my bottle of wine and return home with my staff (disciples). Why one should follow the footprints of patriarchs?

People need your help to be happy. Now everybody is enlightened for you. Love them equally.
Answer the question:-
What is this life? If death comes and takes it, what is this life? What meaning does it carry if one is so impotent against death?
Remember, after birth everybody is on his deathbed. There is no other way. All beds are deathbeds because after birth only one thing is certain, and that is death.
The search for the enlightenment is the search for a real-life, authentic life, which knows no death.Where all search ends.

How do you meditate? Where can I find free calming music for meditating?,"Listening to music is not meditation, listening to music is entertainment or relaxation at the most.
Yes, you can use music as means to enter meditation but meditation will happen in utter silence after all meditation is a journey towards silence.
At the worst people use music to meditate whereas music in itself is a hardwired pattern of seven notes in the human brain which only reinforces old patterns in the brain.
Music is not required to mediate but yes, you can use the natural sound of nature to meditate which will give you calmness and freshness.
When you hear the chirping of birds and when you breathe the fragrance of the flowers you connect with your true-self and that is what makes your meditation flower.

Why is it that we get spiritually inclined when we have an emotional breakdown?,"No one can get into spirituality by planning.
Spirituality is something that happens when death happens, when something stirs your soul.
By death, I mean either death of a relationship, death of a loved one or death of the profession - The Tragedy.
The ordinary world is a world of shadows, where one shadow relates to another shadow and this world is made up of the same stuff as dreams - Maya.
By shadow, I mean ‘ego' or false self.
Only death can break our dream.
Only death leaves us pondering:-
What is life?
This very question gets you to seek the answers to questions:-
Who am I?
What is life?
Is there something beyond life?
Only spirituality has answers to all these questions.

"So I've had this recurring nightmare for 5 years now- I end up in my old house fighting off this invisible entity trying to drag me through the house and up the stairs to my bedroom, where a demon is trying to hurt/torture me. what does this mean?","If I name your demon it is death because it is fear of death.
This happens when one loses faith in God. This is the second plane of reality where all ghosts and gods exist.
This is happening because of a lack of surrender to your God.
To overcome this you will have to surrender to God's will and stop choosing good or bad.
Alternatively, you should start living your life out of love and devotion this will help you heal your heart."
What's the difference between conceptualizing nonduality and directly experiencing nonduality?,"Duality is a natural process of mind of elimination by choosing but it comes with the identification of self with ego (ego is the mind's ‘I' - false-self).
What does non-duality say?
Ego is an illusion and cause of duality.
When you can see your ego as the illusion that means your ego is conceptualizing the non-duality (illusion of ego) in a thousand and one ways.
Who is seeing the ego as an illusion ?
Apparently your ego itself, because your center is ego, which is not your true-self.
You are practising what you have read and heard from others. This is mind munching. This is not your own experience.
e.g. If a kid is warned not to play with fire he won't listen until and unless he gets burnt and out of that experience he remains aware of that fact rest of his life.
As Socrates said - when you become aware of something out of your own experience, you become free of it.
The day ‘ego is an illusion’ will become your experience - you will be free of it.
You will realise your true-self - which is beyond the duality of your mind and which is your ‘isness' like the ‘isness' of trees, birds, sun, stars and moon."
"Why are people restless, always need to do something, and can't stay still? Is this restlessness caused by the ego?","Your mind's ‘I' is ego. Mind is ‘doing' , it has to do something, it has to reach somewhere. It is the very nature of your mind to create thoughts continuously otherwise your mind will not remain.
Mind is a continuous flow of thoughts jumping from one thought to another like a monkey. Sometimes it is hyperactively focussed other times it's noisy because of confusion or tiredness. Mind is restlessness because of its unceasing running.
You can not control mind PERIOD.
But ‘YES' you can transcend the mind altogether.
‘YES' you read it right - you can transcend mind altogether by attaining NO-MIND.
How does one attain NO-MIND?
Let's be clear about one thing - it takes time and patience to become master of your mind but if your mind becomes a slave of you then you can call your mind on demand to work for you otherwise you remain silent and remain in the present moment.
Now the real thing:-
Meditate by witnessing your thoughts - between every two thoughts there will be a gap and this is where the magic of NO-Mind happens, thoughts will be there, but thoughts will start becoming more and more powerless as you don't cooperate with them, you stand aloof and when you keep meditating for months and years these gaps will become longer and longer and one fine day one of the gaps will become permanent - here you enter the state of NO-MIND permanently.
Now, the mind will never bother you unnecessarily."
"Why am I not enlightened while I see the ego as illusory, and I see the thoughtforms in my mind to be just fragments of the mind?","If you can see your ego as the illusion that means your ego is conceptualizing the illusion of ego in a thousand and one ways.

"My TF introduced me to the concept of tf's 11 years ago when we first met, I was married then and he was going to marry soon. Now that I have realized & accepted it he's dismissing it. What's this?","I feel sorry to hear that you have wasted 11 years in misunderstanding but now understand the following :-
Twin flame is just a concept (false sellable story script) based on delusional experiences of people, who think they are spiritual.
So-called twin flame experts try to sell their story by slyly flipping their STORY script onto your life.
Surrender, separation, runner, chaser are all labels just to make the storyline interesting and they know the story attracts gullible people. Every now and then they refer to false stories (script) of their experiences to keep you glued to the storyline.
INTRODUCING the most elusive centre CHARACTER of the story - THE RUNNER.
Runner means an illusion - a dream, a hook.
So-called Runner enjoys his/ her life and the chaser keeps dreaming and screaming and gets fed by lies of so-called twin flames experts.
To be clear - the whole concept is an illusion or fiction.
Young girls and boys come to me with their horror stories of the twin flame.
In one of the stories, a beautiful girl fell in love with a guy and wasted 4 years and at the end of the day ‘Guy' (so-called runner) turned out to be GAY. She thought her love was divine because it was devoid of sexual relationships and one of the well-known twin flame experts kept telling her - this is sacred and divine love.
So-called twin flame experts are more like African Ghanaian Con Artists or better yet to say they also live an illusion.
Nothing can be true in duality (twin)- it is like a weak ego chasing a strong ego. A runner doesn't give a damn and the chaser keeps moving in circles. A twin flame is a stigma, a hurdle to the expansion of human consciousness.
PS: So-called Twin-flames experts keep misguiding deliberately throughout your journey knowing well that it is harming your mental and physical health."
"How is it observed that some people get the state of Samadhi without any efforts may be due to past incarnation achievement, karmas or samskaras?","“You have to move on. I am only a teacher, not a master. I was pretending and I am very sorry!” said Buddha’s master. Buddha was totally shattered and tired.
He went to take a bath in a nearby river, Niranjana. It is a very small river; in the summer it is not even one foot deep. And he was taking a bath, but he was so weak that he could not cross that small current. He had to hang onto a branch of a tree for a few moments to gather some energy so that he could get out of the river.
He felt like cheated in the name of enlightenment. That experience made it clear to him there is no enlightenment.
Though denying to be real master can only be claimed by the real master, according to me Buddha’s master was real courageous master who declared himself charlatan.*
Buddha’s last hook of attachment and of desire to be enlightened disappeared in one stroke. Buddha’s seeking ended. He became available to non-doing- a rest , a point where there was neither the inward nor the outward journey remained. For him, not only the material world was in vain, the spiritual world also became futile.
And he went down to rest. Not that Buddha had to do anything to go into rest. When there was nothing left to worry about, he became sure, became available to rest. He didn't have to make any effort to rest. That night he was completely depressed but relaxed.
When he awoke in the morning, the last star was setting. He watched as the last star was setting; And with its disappearance, he also merged. He became Buddha.
Then people started asking him how did you attain enlightenment? What is the method? If he had said that it was done by this method or that method, he would have been wrong, because he found it only when there was no remedy no method then there was nowhere to go.
Past incarnation achievement, karmas or samskaras get you to start your journey, but Samadhi always happens without efforts, it is a fruit of effortlessness.
Enlightenment/ Samadhi only happens to the one who’s seeking has ended.
*Later Buddha as a master also confirmed similar tactic by saying - “If you meet Buddha on street, just kill him”."
"If root chakra energy increase, does all chakra energy will increase?","You can increase the Prana energy for energy to travel to Sahasrara Chakra (7th Chakra).
All the energy is stored in Kunda just below Muladhara Chakra and every Kunda is connected to a cosmic Kunda.
Apana energy travels downwards and Prana energy travels upwards. All yogi try to increase the amount of Prana so that kundalini travels upwards opening all the chakras.
Because Prana responds to the moon's gravitational pull it has to be purified by different yogic practices. In normal humans, Apana is pulled downwards by the earth gravitational pull that is used for excretion including ejaculation and menstruation for procreation.
Once the prana energy is purified it will increase in 1000 times in proportion to Apana and this will cause the kundalini to travel upward opening all the chakras in pairs.
How would you know if the root chakra is opened?
Symptoms:-
Skin problems and severe itching all over the body.
Damaging Reasons:-
Pornography, over indulgence in sex.
And remember opening of the chakra never happens one by one. It happens in pairs.
Your first chakra is male and the second chakra is female. The third chakra is male and the fourth is female. The fifth chakra is male and the sixth chakra is female.
The seventh chakra (Sahasrara Chakra) is neither male nor female - it is the end of the duality.
When root chakra (Muladhara chakra) meets Sacral Hara chakra (Svadhisthana chakra) then Brahma Granthi (First Psychic Knot) opens and energy moves to Solar Plexus Chakra ( Manipura Chakra) - Manipura Chakra meets Heart Chakra ( Anahata Chakra) and Vishnu Granthi (Second Psychic Knot) opens and energy moves to Vishuddha Chakra ( Throat Chakra) - And lastly, Vishuddha Chakra (male) meets Ajna Chakra (Third eye) and Rudra Granthi (Third Psychic Knot) opens finally energy moves to 7th Chakra - Sahasrara Chakra - This is known as divine orgasm with existence.
This is the end of Maya - duality - The Nirvana, Moksha, Kaivalya, Anal - Haq or Fana.
Remember:- first meeting happens in a sleep state so you don't know about it only visible symptoms appear like skin problems.
The second meeting happens in a dream state you notice that like a dream but you can't control it.
The third meeting happens in a waking state - not only you are aware of it but also you can control your urges in it.
And when energy reaches Sahasrara Chakra - Turiya - the Samadhi happens.
This is the sun ascension of Kundalini.
This is a male Ascension.
This produces Krishna like personality.
Another ascension is the moon ascension where the first chakra meets the fourth chakra, the second chakra meets the fifth and the third chakra meets the sixth chakra.
This produces Buddha like personality.
This is also called female ascension.
Layout of chakras also changes in female Ascension.
Your first chakra is female and the second chakra is male. The third chakra is female and the fourth is male. The fifth chakra is female and the sixth chakra is male.
And remember you are half male and half female. That is why Ardhnarishvar.

Would people believe in God if we were immortal?,"Of course not, at least not in persons and forms.
God is an experience in a deeper sense.
What is that we feel as God?
I am not going to give you some poetic answer here.
Let's understand.
Humans strive for merger of self-consciousness into cosmic consciousness. This thirst to be merged into cosmic consciousness we feel as love, compassion, devotion (God) and longing for enlightenment.
*The Cosmic consciousness as defined by psychiatrist Richard Maurice Bucke, in his book Cosmic Consciousness: A Study in the Evolution of the Human Mind -“Cosmic consciousness is higher form of consciousness than that possessed by the ordinary man.”
**In Cosmic Consciousness, Bucke stated that he discerned three forms, or degrees, of consciousness:[1]Simple consciousness, possessed by both animals and mankindSelf-consciousness, possessed by mankind, encompassing thought, reason, and imaginationCosmic consciousness, which is ""a higher form of consciousness than that possessed by the ordinary man""
***According to Bucke,This consciousness shows the cosmos to consist not of dead matter governed by unconscious, rigid, and unintending law; it shows it on the contrary as entirely immaterial, entirely spiritual and entirely alive; it shows that death is an absurdity, that everyone and everything has eternal life; it shows that the universe is God and that God is the universe, and that no evil ever did or ever will enter into it; a great deal of this is, of course, from the point of view of self consciousness, absurd; it is nevertheless undoubtedly true.
This book was published in 1901 and mystics also say so from centuries.Cosmic Consciousness is the highest form of consciousness and what we feel as God is about our longing to merge our consciousness into cosmic consciousness.

"As we know souls have a memory of their own, why are kids considered pure souls?","The soul is always pure there is no such thing as an impure soul.
Soul has a memory of all the past lives.
As the karmic body(conscious mind) grows a distance is created between soul and karmic body that is where impurity enters in our life and we tend to lose our innocence.
While the karmic body has yet not developed in kids, they are closer to the soul hence very innocent.
Look into the child’s eyes, look and you will only see the innocence. Every child comes with a enormous innocence, but he has to be taught the ways of the society and religion – he has to be taught how to think, how to calculate, how to use logic, how to argue; he has to be taught language, concepts and words. And gradually he loses contact with his own innocence. He becomes polluted and contaminated by society. He becomes an efficient mechanism; he is no more a human.
Once he learns new tricks of mind he is no more the same who used to be innocent.

"How do I start meditating? There seems to be so many different approaches and definitions of the practice—from Hindu yogis, to""scientific"" meditation, to Western ""hippies""—around that I'm suspicious of what's ""actual"" meditation and what's not.","Mind is ‘doing' and meditation is ‘non-doing'.

"What really is enlightenment? Is it some external light like sunlight, Moonlight, fire light, or is it an internal light? If internal, where does it exist?","What is darkness?
Absence of light.
Enlightenment means bringing the light in so that darkness doesn't remain.
As you can't do anything to darkness directly but you can disperse the darkness by bringing the light similarly darkness of your mind (ignorance) can only be removed by the light of right knowing (mind you, I said ‘knowing', not knowledge).
This is what Buddha meant by saying “Appo Deepo Bhava”—'be your own light'.
How do we get to right knowing?
“Believe Nothing,
no matter
where you read it
or who has said it,
not even
if I have said it,
unless it agrees
with your own reason
and your
own common sense.” — Buddha.
Kabir explained the enlightenment in very simple terms. It is paraphrased as: “Just as the oil of the sesame is in the small sesame grain, just as the fire is there in the flint stone, so also is your divine, your enlightenment in you. All you need is to awaken yourself.” That is: Be your own light.
Enlightenment is your true nature.
That is why it is said, “You are already enlightened”.

Is nirvāṇa an emotionless void?,"Nirvana means blowing out the flame of desires and attachments.
Beyond desires and attachments what remains is compassion. Compassion of Buddha is not ordinary love it is just like flower - no one is passing by, no one even notices it in dense forest. It has flowered, standing alone and giving away its fragrance. It will give its frangrance, not because it has to be given to someone. It is just being given irrespective of who passes by or no one passes by. If someone passes by and can't even notice the flower - he is bound to notice its fragrance.
Enlightened being becomes empty of negative emotions and what remains is not positive emotions but the understanding - an understanding which comes out of his being.
Positive and negative are two ends of the duality and enlightened being lives beyond these two ends.
And
Beyond these ends of the worldly affairs, godliness breathes - enlightened being lives out of that godliness.

Where can I find genuine self-realized guru? I started meditation in year 2020 and now I am going through heart chakra opening also known as dark night of soul.,"Every chakra blockage seems like dark night of the soul as any imbalance in the chakras causes similar symptoms which look like ‘Dark Night of the soul' because all lower chakras below heart chakra lead to a mental body that is why all blockages below the fourth body (mental body) have similar symptoms.
As you have mentioned you started meditating in 2020, one thing is clear your kundalini is awakened and somehow travelled up (upward travel) to Solar Plexus Chakra (Manipura Chakra/Astral Body) by breaking the Brahma Granthi ( 1st Psychic Knot).
If you are having intense real-like dreams and nausea then you are moving in the astral plane and the blockage is at Manipura Chakra.
Your journey of Etheric Body (second body) is complete now because your Kundalini has gone back to Kunda it has become dormant. That is the reason you are having symptoms of Blocked Heart Chakra ( aka ‘dark night of the soul').
Solution:-
Have light liquid food and practice gratitude, forgiveness and surrender.
PS: Whenever your body will be at rest your kundalini will travel to Manipura Chakra again and again.
Important:
*Great masters like Gurdjieff, Osho and even Lord Shiva have talked about Chakras and Kundalini, if master can't gauge the stage of the seeker by the movement of Prana in chakras then he is Naive and nowhere near to Awakening, he should introspect and find enlightened Guru rather than misguiding people because of his/her own limited exposure or no exposure.
** If one can't feel the movement of Prana in chakras and thinks he/she is awakened or enlightened then he/she is nowhere near to awakening and everything they are experiencing is mind games.

What is courage?,"Courage is not fearlessness. Courage is not being a gambler. Courage is about moving into the unknown in spite of having fear and uncertainty.
Courage is not about know-it-all. Courage is about not-knowing-at-all.
Courage is about saying ‘Yes' and taking responsibility for the consequences.
Courage is about saying ‘No' and being ready for consequences.
Courage means living life by heart."
Why is transcendence important to human people?,"Transcendence is the highest possibility for humans and very few transcend the human mind.
It is the culmination of human sufferings, it is the epiphany of human possibility.
Transcendence for humans always remained the ultimate quest where one becomes immune to human frailties. Where one is more like God.
He can create and destroy his worlds with just one thought. He becomes immortal and death becomes a door to yet another journey - journey to eternity."
Can a follower/disciple be more awake than the guru?,"‘More’ or ‘less' is language of mind, either one is awakened or not.
Either you have reached or you have not, there is no way to define quantity of enlightenment - one can't say my left foot has reached home and the right foot is about to reach home.
What do you think awakening is the percentage like school grade?
I want to spill the beans- Anyone who says he is awakened with strings is not awakened at all."
"If the waking state is also a dream, what does that make the people in our life? Are they a “Jiva” in their own right or our projection?","Waking state is made up of the same stuff as dreams. Dreams are fantasy islands with no boundaries of their own.
A waking state is a dream with boundaries where one shadow relates to another.
By shadow, I mean ‘ego' - your false self.
Where ego keeps proposing, propagating and projecting without knowing an end to this endless quest.
Yes, everybody (including you) is a projection based on who is projecting and Jiva also."
How are enlightened people in a constant state of non-resistance? Isn't resistance necessary in some circumstances (such as resisting/avoiding hunger)?,"Resistance is because of the duality of the mind and ‘cause and effect’ construct of the conscious mind.
Beyond the conscious mind, there is only “isness”.
‘Isness' doesn't belong to the mind, it belongs to the existence, it belongs to Now and Here.
‘Isness' of an enlightened being is like ‘isness' of the trees, ‘isness' of the birds, ‘isness' of the sea, moon stars and Sun.
Do they need resistance to live?"
What is the best age to get into spirituality?,"No one can get into spirituality by planning …………….. if you step into spirituality by planning then you are living the myth of spirituality.
Spirituality is something that happens when death happens, when something stirs your soul.
By death, I mean either death of a relationship, death of a loved one or death of the profession - The Tragedy.
The ordinary world is a world of shadows, where one shadow relates to another shadow and this world is made up of the same stuff as dreams - Maya.
By shadow, I mean ‘ego' or false self.

How can I stop creating thoughts and just perceive my environment and focus my attention outwards?,"Your mind is thoughts, your thought is mind. It is the very nature of your mind to create thoughts continuously otherwise your mind will not remain.
‘Just perceiving environment' is also thoughts and ‘focussing attention outwards' is also thought. The only difference is some thoughts are outwards and some thoughts are inwards.
Mind is a continuous flow of thoughts jumping from one thought to another. Sometimes it is hyperactively focussed other times it's noisy because of confusion or tiredness.
You can not control mind PERIOD.
But ‘YES' you can transcend the mind altogether.
‘YES' you read it right - you can transcend mind altogether by attaining NO-MIND.
How does one attain NO-MIND?
Let's be clear about one thing - it takes time and patience to become master of your mind but if your mind becomes a slave of you then you can call your mind on demand to work for you otherwise you remain silent and remain in the present moment.
Now the real thing:-
Meditate by witnessing your thoughts - between every two thoughts there will be a gap and this is where the magic of NO-Mind happens, thoughts will be there, but thoughts will start becoming more and more powerless as you don't cooperate with them, you stand aloof and when you keep meditating for months and years these gaps will become longer and longer and one fine day one of the gaps will become permanent - here you enter the state of NO-MIND permanently.
Now, the mind will never bother you unnecessarily ever."
"If suffering is a choice, then why do maximum people choose to suffer in life?","Many suns ago, maybe billions years, a man and a woman had the desire to have a kid and they made love then you are born.
Don't think you are 29–35–42 years old, you are as old as this earth. Your journey is millions of years long and it all started with a desire.
Do trees have desires? - Yes, no doubt trees do have the desire, that is how they survive. The seed becomes a tree -> tree produces fruits-> fruit again produces seeds-> seed becomes a tree again. This is what we know as a circle of life.
The very fabric of our life is the desire and it is also a source of suffering.
Desires produce more desires and attachments then this circle of life as suffering continues.

That is why Buddha's path is of desirelessness. The day you become utterly desireless you become deathless.

"Why do enlightened people say ""I"" don't exist, but they also say ""I alone exist"" ? What is the meaning of this contradiction?","अक्षराणामकारोऽस्मि द्वन्द्व: सामासिकस्य च |
अहमेवाक्षय: कालो धाताहं विश्वतोमुख: || 10.33||
BG 10.33: I am the beginning “A” amongst all letters; I am the dual word in grammatical compounds. I am the endless Time, and amongst creators I am Brahma.
When Krishna says “I”, he doesn't use “I” as an ‘EGO' he has to use “I” as utilitarian. This is a limitation of our language. But if you can see behind Krishna's “I” you will see emptiness, utter emptiness, there is no ‘ego', so he doesn't exist as an ‘ego'.
Krishna has merged with cosmic consciousness(Brahman) so Krishna exists as a face of Cosmic consciousness and cosmic consciousness exists everywhere - Brahman is eternal that which existed before this universe and will remain after the destruction of this universe. The universes are created and destroyed by cosmic consciousness (Brahman). So Krishna ( cosmic consciousness ) alone exists and everything else is born and dies in it.
Don't confuse your ‘I' and enlightened being's “I”.

Do I have to lose my mind to find my soul?,"The soul is also part of your being, it is inclusive. Mind is real too, it is your identification with your mind that keeps you away from the soul.
You don't have to lose your mind to reach your soul, you just have to dis-identify with your mind.
The moment you dis-identify with your mind, you will know you are not your feelings, you are not your thoughts - you are not even your mind.
And
You stand as a blank slate - Tabula Rasa, exactly like you were born. You attain an eternal part of your being.
Then great bliss rises in your being and that bliss is called - Self-realisation, enlightenment, Kavalaya or Fanna.
Now the real thing;-
How to dis-identify from your mind?
Ego is altered or inflated or deflated state of mind - so just witness your feelings and thoughts - just stand aloof, choose nothing, neither this nor that, let the witness uncover, once you become witness of your ego permanently, you will reach witness of this Universe - The God or Cosmic Consciouness.

I feel like becoming a monk and joining a monastery. Should I do that?,"Run to the monastery, run to Himalayan Master, run to the Himalayas or you run to the nearest theatre to watch the latest movie. There is no difference.
This unceasing running is the cause of your turmoil.
Become a monk, become president, become a priest or you become Sadhguru. There is no difference.
‘Becoming' is a disease and this is the cause of your turmoil.

How do I pick a specific spiritual path to reach goals in life?,"Goals, achievements and ambitions are part of the material world.
Spirituality has nothing to do with achieving or ambitious mind. Spirituality means ‘I want to know myself'. Spirituality means moving inward.
Ambitions mean politics and politicians are anything but not spiritual.
This unceasing running to something and somewhere is the cause of all turmoil in your life. You want to be someone and the last thing you think of is ‘remaining yourself'.
Spirituality means ceasing to be someone or something.
‘Becoming' is the disease and one who becomes himself is the most spiritual person in this world."
Why do people feel lonely?,"If you feel that you are alone then you are feeling loneliness.
There is a difference between being alone and being lonely.
Aloneness is the state of joy that comes from within.
Loneliness is longing for the company of someone.
Loneliness depends on others and is always incomplete whereas aloneness is being whole without depending on others.
Aloneness is wonderful whereas loneliness is ugly.
You never feel aloneness because it is the joy of being."

"If the self is just an illusion, who has achieved enlightenment if there is no self?","Self is not an illusion but false self as an ego is illusion.
Ego is false self (away from your true-self) which is formed in your early growing age and which is given by society, religion and political ideology.
Enlightenment is about breaking the shell that is formed in ignorance of early age.
Or
You can prefer to keep the false-self and keep feeding it like most politicians, religious leaders and rulers do.
It is this realisation that brings you to the seeking of true-self.
Self is not illusion, it is as true as sun, moon and stars but false self is an illusion."
"How can your twin flame care about you so much, but at the same time keep playing you like a fool, then sneak around behind your back and pretend like your'e the crazy one when you know everything about what they are doing?","Twin flame is just a concept (false sellable story script) based on delusional experiences of people, who think they are spiritual.
So-called twin flame experts try to sell their story by slyly flipping their STORY script onto your life.
Surrender, separation, runner, chaser are all labels just to make the storyline interesting and they know the story attracts gullible people. Every now and then they refer to false stories (script) of their experiences to keep you glued to the storyline.
INTRODUCING the most elusive centre CHARACTER of the story - THE RUNNER.
Runner means an illusion - a dream, a hook.
So-called Runner enjoys his/ her life and the chaser keeps dreaming and screaming and gets fed by lies of so-called twin flames experts.
To be clear - the whole concept is an illusion or fiction.
Young girls and boys come to me with their horror stories of the twin flame.
In one of the stories, a beautiful girl fell in love with a guy and wasted 4 years and at the end of the day ‘Guy' (so-called runner) turned out to be GAY. She thought her love was divine because it was devoid of sexual relationships and one of the well-known twin flame experts kept telling her - this is sacred and divine love.
So-called twin flame experts are more like African Ghanaian Con Artists or better yet to say they also live an illusion.
Nothing can be true in duality (twin)- it is like a weak ego chasing a strong ego. A runner doesn't give a damn and the chaser keeps moving in circles. A twin flame is a stigma, a hurdle to the expansion of human consciousness.
PS: So-called Twin-flames experts keep misguiding deliberately throughout your journey knowing well that it is harming your mental and physical health."
Why are some spiritually awakened people mean or harsh?,"Words ‘mean’ and ‘harsh’ have meaning according to your understanding.
Spiritually awakened person can be ‘harsh’ but ‘mean’ is overstretching of the fact ‘not accepting the truth’.
Truth is harsh, truth is bitter, truth is more like medicine which tastes bitter but ultimately it cures you.
The spiritually awakened person can only speak the truth there is no other way for him to survive in this world. He is not your Papa or Mummy, not even your uncle. He will never lie to please you.
Spiritually Awakened person is mirror of the life which is always not merry-go-round. Life is zigzag. You have to live life like walking on tightrope, balancing to right and to left also with pole.
Whenever you feel someone was harsh to you just go inside and ask - Are you looking for the observation or the confirmation?
Confirmation requires validation and validation pleases you and invalidation displeases you.
Observation requires you to have keen eye and open mind, keen eye is optional but open mind is not.
Spiritually awakened person will tell you what is truth he won’t layout the best possible scenario."
"Is it true that from the beginning of creation to the end, from darkness to God-realization, all beings go through all possible incarnations and varieties of different spiritual states, through the equivalent experiences without exception?","Technically there are thousands of people living inside of you already.
Jesus was passing through a town at night, and there was a man in the cemetery beating his chests and his body with stones, bleeding.
Jesus approached him and asked, “Why are you doing that?”
The man replied, “I am only doing what the whole world is doing.” Again he started to hurt himself, beating his head till it bled.
Jesus asked, “What is your name, madman?”
The man replied, “My names are legion. I don’t have one name, I have thousands of names.”
Just think about it how much of your Dad is inside of you and how much of Mummy is inside of you. Brothers, sisters, cousins and friends are inside of you.
Don't forget you also have brought your ancestors in your DNA.
Yes, you have to live thousands of lives before you reach your true-self, otherwise, you remain split.
Crystallization happens by living and eliminating every bit of absurdity you have collected from your life."
"I see that everything in life is impermanent, and that even the ""I""-ego keeps changing. But I still have not realized the unchanging, unmoving consciousness. How to recognize & abide in this unmoving presence?","You have already experienced pure consciousness many times it is just lost Eden as Upanishads say there is nothing that is created it is all about discovering it at right place and time.
Pure consciousness is within you and you just have to silence your mind.
It is certainly not easy it takes time but the methods are really easy:-
All you need a ‘heart full of love’ and meditation.
or rather I would say one who is capable of loving can be meditative otherwise people look at meditation as an alternative medicine for all kind of neurosis.
People come to me and ask me how can I get more of silence. Now how can I tell them silence is silence there is no quantity of it.
When you love, your ego dissolves into love, it melts into love.
Just remember love simplifies your mind and only a simplified mind can remain in present.
It is my own experience people who are loving and caring tend to live life like a child.
Surprisingly what you are finding hard to be in, once it was your natural state.
Look into the child’s eyes, look and you will see tremendous silence and innocence. Every child comes with a natural state of meditativeness, but he has to be taught the ways of the society and religion – he has to be taught how to think, how to calculate, how to use logic, how to argue; he has to be taught language, concepts and words. And gradually he loses contact with his own innocence. He becomes polluted and contaminated by society. He becomes an efficient mechanism; he is no more a human.
Once he learns new tricks of mind he is no more the same who used to be innocent.
But there is good news…… that you just have to regain what you have lost during your growing years. The possibility is inside of you.
All that is needed is to regain that silent space once more. You have known it before, so when for the first time you taste meditation, a great feeling will arise in you as if you have known it before. And that feeling is true: you have known it before as your natural state. You have forgotten. But if you can uncover it, you will find that again – it is always yours.
We are born as meditators and our natural state remains hidden somewhere deep down. Any day, a little digging, and you will find your natural state still flowing.
And the greatest joy in life is to find it again.
How to find it?
Just meditate by witnessing.
While witnessing there will be gaps between any two thoughts and as you keep meditating these gaps will become larger and larger and one fine day one of the gaps will become permanent - you will enter no-mind. The permanent cessation of the mind as master.
You will reach the silent space - where there is no noise of past and future, you will live here and now.

"Why are we rushing to escape samsara? There are bad parts, but if Brahman created samsara for us to play in, why are we trying to leave it?","The grass looks greener on the other side.
The mind always needs something else. The mind gets bored easily. As our body is comfortable with known and forms habits easily but our mind always needs newness and what else can give the greatest adventure (newness) than mysteries of enlightenment.
If you can't become Jeff Bezos, become Buddha.
‘Becoming' is the illness of the mind.
Samsara is as beautiful as the other side.
There is absolutely no need to run from it.
Live life in its totality and out of totality the authentic striving for Moksha will arise like it happened to Siddhartha.
Suppressed or repressed life can only give confusing questions like this one."
Can we lead a spiritual life while being with family?,"Absolutely No,
It is next to impossible to be spiritual while being with family.
Spirituality requires you to be in complete Vairāgya - a state of non-being.
You can be religious while living with family but being spiritual takes more than what people think of spirituality.
Family and spirituality are diametrically opposites, being in family means being in Samsara and Vairāgya means Sannyas from Samsara.
If you are going to create attachments like family and kids then you should better learn to live with family. Don’t be escapist.
You can’t have best of both worlds.
You want to have cake and eat it too?
There is a Romanian expression: “Cu fundul în două luntri“, which means “Sitting with your bum in two boats”."
"Should I listen to Osho, Sadhguru or J. Krishnamurti?","As a rule of spirituality, you should read anything and everything because you never know what will trigger the awakening. Buddha got enlightened watching last morning star. Lao Tzu got enlightened watching the dry leaf falling from a tree. There are instances when the seeker got enlightened listening to the false prophet.
Spiritual awakening is the path of the unknown and every bit of information you collect is going to help you in one or another way.
I used to read the books of Edwards De Bono to improve my thinking skill and I have been using his methods like ‘Six thinking hats, ‘Six Frames' and Lateral thinking. I used to enjoy the techniques and I fully applied those techniques for 11 years. One fine day I found the similarities between the ‘Six thinking hats' and our ‘Chakra System'.
So make it a rule to read anything that catches your fancy.
No-method is the best method and getting ‘bored' of everything in this world is the ultimate path to enlightenment."
Is spiritual awakening just a beginning to a goal of enlightenment or a state called “enlightenment”?,"Spirituality is all about the expansion of the consciousness and enlightenment is the total flowering of the human consciousness.
Now let's understand spiritual awakening.
The expansion of consciousness has three stages each stage supersedes the lower one.
Stage 1: When one comes to understanding the value of his/her life, the very first time his/ her consciousness turns inside and this insight gives the first lesson:-
“Your life is the most precious gift in this universe.”
Stage 2: When one comes to understanding the meaning of love. Love is not possessiveness. Love is not sex. Love is giving unconditionally.
“Love is about your inner state, it doesn't depend on the other person.”
Stage 3: When one comes to understanding that every positive comes with negative. When one transcends the duality of life.
You come to know the TRUTH - What is Truth? - “Truth is to see things as they are and live with them as they exist.”
You stop cursing life, you stop cursing God, you stop cursing yourself because now you know the meaning of life.
Your understanding of life is complete.
Life is bitter and sweat also, laughter and tears also. One who doesn’t know how to cry , he can’t know how to laugh. One who doesn’t enjoy laughter, his tears will be crocodile tears. You don't choose one thing against other anymore.
You learn the last lesson - Life is about ‘being’ not ‘living’.

"In a spiritual journey, you feel some pain (it is like some other soul). Why is this happening?","Spirituality is the path of paradoxes. Only paradoxes can give space to strangeness and strangeness is what shakes you - gives you ‘dark night of the soul'.
Anything that gives you peace is giving you a false doctrine.
For example, almost everybody believes there is God. Now God is the reason for your duality and till you start to doubt the existence of God your third eye will not open.
That is the reason the opening of the third eye is so rare. But once you dare to question the existence of God your sixth chakra (third eye) will open. Opening of third eye releases all the overload on your body and brain.Your body becomes weightless.
Awakening is the start of a new journey and before spiritual awakening, everything is a mess.
Before awakening, this world is a madhouse where people live unconsciously and what else can you expect from the person who is going through the ‘dark night of the soul'. He is on the verge of going mad or insane."
Is it necessary to have a quiet space when you want to meditate?,"Absolutely not,
You can meditate even on the battle ground.
Restlessness is the very nature of the mind because mind is ‘doing' and meditation is non-doing.
Mediation means ‘just drop the efforts'.
Meditation is mean not the end.
Meditation is something beyond mind. Meditation can help you reduce your erratic thoughts. But still, thoughts will remain.
Meditation is one and crucial part of the inner work. Meditation alone can not ensure inner peace.
If meditation is making you a bit silent then meditation is not working on you.
Meditation should shake you, it should give you a ‘dark night of the soul'.
Inner peace can not be ascertained till your mind remains. It will be one day peaceful other day hell.
Inner alchemy happens when you attain no-mind.
I totally disagree with people who keep meditating for decades. They have not worked on inner transformation. They have missed the point.
The only purpose of meditation is to transcend meditation when your life becomes a meditation. You don't sit even for 5 minutes to attain inner peace. Inner peace prevails in every moment of life. Meditation happens in every moment of life.
Your walking is meditation, your eating is meditation and your sleeping is meditation. You become a meditation.

"If insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results, what's the difference between determination and insanity?","Doing 2+2 and expecting 5 again again is insanity.
Doing 1+4 and expecting 5 is sanity.
Doing 2+3 and expecting 5 is sanity.
Knowing 2+2 equals 4 is being sane."
Why do I feel strong energy in Manipur Chakra or solar plexus chakra at time of chanting Mantra?,"Bhakti yoga works with your astral body - the third body and mantra chanting works with your etheric - the second body.
When you chant mantra you are working with your second and third body and energy starts to move into higher chakra ie Solar Plexus.
As your Kundalini is awakened it starts the ascension towards the heart chakra but your heart chakra is blocked so the energy settles in solar plexus chakra."
"Can we really control our thoughts, for example, by avoiding thinking about something?","If the snake bites itself does it die?
How can you control mind by mind?
Our mind is the most complex mechanism in the world. The more you avoid something it will recollide with greater force. This question reminds me of a famous Tibetan parable.
An old saint knew how to fly and he became very famous. A young man got interested in knowing the secret. He swore that he would devote his whole life to know the secret to flying. He started to live with the old saint.
………
After few months, tired of the young man, because twenty-four hours a day he was there…Finally the old man got fed up. He told the young fellow, “Today I am going to tell you the secret. It is not very difficult. It is very simple.”
He said, “Everything is hidden in the mantra —Om mani padme hum.”
The young man said, “ Don't fool me. This is the mantra everbody knows.”
The old saint said, “ I am going to give you the secret key to open this mantra nobody knows.”
The young man said, “Key? I have never heard that there is a key to open the mantra.”
“The key is, while you are repeating the mantra – just for three minutes – don’t let any monkey pop into your head.”
The young man said, “You seem to be an old idiot! In my whole life I have never thought of a monkey. Why should I think of one?”
He rushed down the stairs of the temple where the old saint lived. But strangely, even though he was not chanting the mantra, monkeys started coming. He would close his eyes and they would be there. He would run to this side and they would be there. They were not outside, they were inside his head. As far as he could see, only monkeys and monkeys.
Somehow he tried to sleep but all night monkeys kept crowding his head and the house.
By the morning he was so tired that he rushed to old saint and said, “Please take away your key. I am almost mad!”
The old man said, “That’s why I was not telling anybody, because the key is very difficult. Now do you understand why I was silent? Now it is almost impossible to take back the key.”
He said, “I don’t want to listen to a single word from you. You just take this key back and let me go home. And I don’t want these monkeys to follow me!”
The man dropped the mantra, he dropped the key. He closed his eyes and there was no monkey. He looked all around and there was no monkey. He tried just once on the way, to see what happens when he says Om mani padme hum and closes his eyes. And they were all coming, from all directions.
All your thoughts are monkeys. Never force any thought to go away; otherwise it will rebound with greater energy. And the energy is yours! You are on a self-defeating track. The more you throw it away the more it will come back.

What's the catch?
You can attain no-mind to choose to either use it or not to use it at WILL.
How to you attain no-mind?
Meditate by witnessing your thoughts.When you meditate, there will be gaps between two thoughts and as you keep meditating for years the gaps will become larger and larger and one fine day one of the gaps will become permanent and you enter state of no-mind.

What is the difference between ego and confidence?,"Confidence is about ‘moving inward' and ego is about ‘moving outward'.
Confidence is to move to your centre and and ego is to move away from your centre.
Ego says, “I shall show you - Who am I?”
Confidence says, “I know myself - Let the world know.”
Ego is an altered state (inflated or deflated) of your -SELF or it's false Self like sadness.
Confidence is knowing your true self.
When you move inward you reach the centre of your being."
What are some signs of spiritual awakening?,"Spiritual Awakening has clear symptoms on our physical body because spiritual awakening stirs changes in our chakras and kundalini.
Symptoms:-
Root chakra + Sacral Hara Chakra opening= Skin problems (rashes on inner thighs something like bacterial infection) and severe itching all over the body.
Solar Plexus + Heart Chakra opening = Light Jaundice + High Blood Pressure and high heartbeat.
Throat Chakra + Third eye ( 6th Chakra) = High Blood Pressure, sore throat + Swollen Eyes and heavy energy build up around eyebrows.
Damaging Reasons:-
Pornography, over indulgence in sex.
I know people struggling for decades because they just don't change or they run from one spiritual experience to another having a distinct ego of being divine.
I always tell them that they are having BAD experiences not spiritual experiences.
There is a difference.
Here is a real thing:- Spiritual Awakening causes Kundalini Awakening also and when kundalini travels then awakening of the first two chakras happens in a sleep state (totally unconscious) and awakening of 3rd and 4th chakras happens in the dream state, it happens like a dream the awakening of 5th and 6th chakra happens in waking state, this is where your third eye opens and the vision of world changes in a burst.
Unfortunately, people don't know and spend their whole life in the lower 3 chakras and keep taking medicines without knowing the real cause of their psychological and health problems.
Kundalini awakening is a natural process of transformation. But when we say ‘No' to life we block our chakras.
I have met many people whose chakras are blocked. Most of the people have a hard time unblocking their heart chakra because of the lack of trust and surrender. They live their life in doubts and only doubts. They keep moving in the circles shifting their preference between desires of things and persons and that is why they have little to no possibility of transforming their life.
Kundalini is always there, kundalini is the life-force and what you know as death is the withdrawal of kundalini and LIFE is all about opening of chakras and keeping them balanced.

How do we know that Sri Ramakrishna or Sri Ramana Maharishi were self realized as Self Realization is an internal experience and not visible to anybody? Even the experience that Sri Ramakrishna had of Mother Kaali was in his mind's eye.,"Those who gathered around Ramana Maharishi and Ramakrishna Paramhamsha must have had some glimpses of the divine.
An enlightened being needs to prove nothing. His presence becomes an expression of his fulfilment. His presence says, “It has happened to me and it is your possibility too.”
Even the experience that Sri Ramakrishna had of mother Kaali was in his mind’s eye.
Here’s real story about Sri Ramakrishna and Mother Kaali:-
Ramakrishna was a great devotee, and the path of devotion is full of imagination.
Ramakrishna was a devotee of the Mother Goddess of Calcutta.
An enlightened man, Totapuri, was just passing by. He looked at Ramakrishna and he felt great compassion for the fellow. He told Ramakrishna:
“You think that you have experienced the Mother Goddess.”
Ramakrishna said: “See, I have talked with her, and not one day, but every day.” He was an honest man, and what he was saying was true.
Totapuri laughed and he said: “Listen, that Mother Goddess is nothing but pure imagination. Unless you drop that you will never become enlightened. So sit down. I will remain here for three or four days, just for you. I have to help you in somehow dropping the Mother Goddess.”
Now that was a very difficult matter. Ramakrishna had loved the Mother Goddess his whole life, danced before her. He used to prepare food for her, He used to fight with the Mother Goddess. And he was not a traditional fellow; he was very untraditional, very loving, very innocent. His imagination of Mother Goddess was so real. Nobody could understand him.
Totapuri said to Ramakrishna: “You sit in silence.
You don’t have any other ropes (hooks) that I can see, just this one rope. So when you see the Mother Goddess arising in your imagination, just take the sword and cut the mother in two pieces. They will fall, and with them will fall the last barrier.”
Ramakrishna said: “From where am I going to get the sword?”
Totapuri said: “From where have you got this Mother Goddess? — From the same place. It is your imagination. That is also your imagination; only imagination is needed to cut imagination.”
It took three days because he would go into meditation and the Mother Goddess would be standing there, and he would forget all about Totapuri. He would forget all about the sword, and tears would star flowing from his eyes, and Totapuri would shake him saying: “What are you doing?”
Ramakrishna said: “What to do? — Because once I see her, she is so beautiful…. Don’t force me to cut her.”
Totapuri said: “Listen, I can see even from the outside:
your face immediately changes when you see the mother. I have brought a piece of glass, and the moment I see that you are seeing the mother —because your tears start flowing, your face becomes so beautiful — I will make the cut on your third eye centre with the glass. I have to do this because tomorrow I leave. I cannot waste any more time. This is the last chance: either you do it or I am finished with you.”
And Totapuri said: “When I cut your forehead and blood starts flowing, don’t hesitate, just take the sword and cut the mother.”
Ramakrishna cut the mother and he remained silent for six days. Totapuri remained for six days, and when Ramakrishna opened his eyes he thanked Totapuri and said: “If you had not come, I would have lived my whole life with the hallucination. My last barrier has fallen away.”
Ramakrishna became enlightened after he had cut the last barrier.
The path of devotion is full of imagination. If you continuously go on insisting on a certain hypothetical concept of God, one day you will see that hypothesis becoming a reality.
Christian can't see Krishna. Mohammedans can't see Jesus and likewise Hindu can't see Jesus. They all can see what they believe in what is their hypothesis.
God is nothing but pure imagination. Very few people are able to drop that and very few people become enlightened.
That is how Bhakti Marg works, you drop the last rope which is keeping you clinging to an illusionary world called Maya.
Buddha said, “ If you meet Buddha on the street, just kill him.”
God is the imagination (Maya) and until you destroy that you won't break out of illusion (Maya). God is a subtle hook of Maya.
Destroy the imaginary idol of God. This is the last step to liberation. The only hook remaining, this is where most people fail."
How does one know if they are in a separation or surrender phase in a TF journey?,"Separation and surrender are your state of mind, it has nothing to do with twin flames.
Let's look at other terms used in twin flames circle.
Runner means an illusion - a dream, a hook. So-called Runner enjoys his/ her life and the chaser keeps dreaming and screaming and gets fed by lies of so-called twin flames experts to be clear - the whole concept is an illusion or fiction.
Young girls and boys come to me with their horror stories of the twin flames in one of the stories, a beautiful girl fell in love with a guy and wasted 4 years and at the end of the day ‘Guy' (so-called runner) turned out to be GAY. She thought her love was divine because it was devoid of sexual relationships and one of the well-known twin flame experts kept telling her - this is sacred and divine love.
So-called twin flame experts are more like African Ghanaian Con Artists or better yet to say they also live an illusion.
Nothing can be true in duality (twin)- it is like a weak ego chasing a strong ego. A runner doesn't give a damn and the chaser keeps moving in circles. A twin flame is a stigma, a hurdle to the expansion of human consciousness."
How is hate related to love?,"Love and hate are two sides of the same coin. They are not opposites, they complement each other. If you love the person then someday you will hate him too. These are different directions of the same energy and love can turn into hate but the centre of your concern will remain the same person.
So if somebody loves you then be ready to face his hatred someday also.The source of happiness will ultimately become a reason for the sorrows.
If you are rejoicing at present, be ready for the absence of the person whose presence is bringing joy to you.
This is what we know as the duality of life and duality is the reason for our unhappiness.
Remember - “You can't have the honey without the flies.”
With every positive there comes a negative.
The day you can look beyond happiness and sadness, love and hate, pain and pleasure, you will become immortal.

Is our intuition related to chakras? Is that related with “got feeling”?,"There is more important question which will make the answer more relevant to you question:-
What makes our intuition not to work?
Our mind is wonderful as logical mechanism but at the same time it is also full of illogical constructs which we get in our growing age from 7–20 yrs i.e. our conscious mind develops fully by the age of 20–21 years. During that age we get lot of conditioning or thinking patterns as our nature and due to that we are not able to see what is truth or we think through our knowledge and the intuition comes from our pure consciousness aka awareness where fiction of mind does not exist.
In other words , intuition is the result of your absolute knowing which comes as glimpse from the clear knowing (Ajna Chakra).
Intuition is always available, it comes from the state of ‘not knowing' , not feeling."
Do you really need a guru? What about the self realized beings who had no guru?,"The path of self-realisation is full of paradoxes and pain.
The only One who has walked the talk can help you otherwise you will listen to empty words and hollow answers.
Even self-realised won't be able to put that in words what he has experienced. He only can point his finger to the moon. What to talk about people who just have read books and scriptures.
Without the Master it is difficult. One has to come to somebody who has come to know by himself. The books may be of help and the books do contain great wisdom, but you will decode it according to your mind. That will falsify the wisdom in the book.
There are very few who achieved self-realisation without the enlightened master, you can count on your fingers.
One of Patanjali′s Sutras reads:

Pratyaksa anumana agamah pramanani
Meaning:
Right knowledge has three sources:
Direct Cognition
Inference
The words of the awakened ones
If your consciousness is capable of the first two points then you can read the words of the awakened one and get enlightened, but it will take very very long.
So the first step for a seeker is to seek a Master. If you can find a Master, half the journey is over."
"If a person was to come to the knowledge that they are not a person and then choose to become enlightened, what does that make them?","Enlightenment is about knowing not about knowledge.
Enlightenment is about choicelessness not about choices.
Knowledge is the biggest barrier in the path of enlightenment. Knowledge belongs to mind and enlightenment belongs to no-mind.
Choices belong to mind or mind is choices and choicelessness belongs to no-mind.
In nutshell, the mind is doing and enlightenment is the result of having arrived at the point where all action becomes wei wu wei, or action without action (non-forcing).

Is it normal to feel your heartbeat buzzing? I felt my heartbeat through my chest and it felt super clear and then felt it through my wrist and it felt like it was buzzing but it only lasted like 10 seconds. I've never felt that before. Am I okay?,"Yes, you are perfectly okay. Those 10 seconds were when you slipped into state of no-mind aka pure consciousness.
You could have noted many other things like brighter lights and the broader view had it lasted for a few minutes or hours.
But don't worry it will happen again but you will have to avoid striving for the same experience and stop sharing your experiences if you want it to happen again."
"If many twin flames don't come into union because they aren't ready for it in this lifetime, what might be some signs that they are ready for union in this life?","You should expect the union in your next lifetime. Twin flames are never meant to unite.
In fact, you should give up hope to unite as who knows you will take next birth or not.
Ultimately you have to forget your twin flame because that concept is designed that way. Twin flame is either runner or chaser, runner means an illusion - a dream, a hook and chaser means sucker.
So-called Runner enjoys his/ her life and the chaser keeps dreaming and screaming and keeps sucking ideas fed by so-called twin flame experts.

"What should be my expectation re union? I am anxious as My Twin Flame and I are both married to others and we are both older . Should I expect physical union in our lifetime, or be more realistic and expect it in our next lifetime?","You should expect it in your next lifetime. Twin flames are never meant to unite.

"Can humans really attain enlightenment, or is it a big step for us?","This is a paradox only humans can attain enlightenment because the rest of everything is already enlightened.
The unenlightened state of humans has given us all the art and science.
These rocks, trees, birds, animals and the whole of the universe is already enlightened that is the reason humans strive for enlightenment.
It is a big step for us - Millions of people think of enlightenment - few thousand discuss about it - few hundred start the seeking - only one in million reaches and one in billions will come back to tell you mysteries of the path to enlightenment.
But the beauty of the journey is alone one has to seek and alone one has to reach. No one can help you to reach and everything you read are just finger pointing to the moon.
Those who enjoy the journey will reach the absolute.

"Has anyone ever looked at a person in their eyes and their eyes light up like diamonds sparkle, literally? Is this like their aura? Is it a spiritual awakening in their soul?","Most likely you met the person with the open heart chakra and the connection was made soul to the soul without a doubt it happens sometimes when you meet someone and that moment of connection, minds of both people become one and then communion happens between the souls.
This has little to do with spiritual awakening, it has something to do with synchronicity and it happens many times in life but we live a very unconscious life that is why we miss it 99 out of a hundred times."
"Buddha says desire is the cause of all suffering and all desires should be eliminated. Survival is also a desire, then how do you eliminate that?","When you are ready to annihilate all your desires and attachments your desire for survival also dies.
You eliminate that desire too and out of that depth of desirelessness, a renewed desire arises to be born again as a understanding and compassionate ‘new you'.
Whatsoever Buddha said, he said it specifically in reference to get enlightened. Otherwise, his advice is not practical.
So ignore Buddha's advice and Eat, drink and sleep."
How do I stop questioning reality so much like I understand that life is a big illusion and that I need to stay in the moment and all of that but my mind always is looking for more. How do I calm my mind and let go (other than meditation)?,"Other than meditation you can start to do something you always love to do, where you forget the sense of time and place.
When you do something you love to do your work becomes meditation. Though your mind is active but it falls into the Alpha state of mind which is the first stage of meditation.
There are other deeper states of meditation that will be available as you start enjoying your work.
e.g. When you start to enjoy your work then you will have rare insights which will come from the Theta State of mind and some of your Eureka moments will also come from the Delta state of mind.
In some of our favourite endeavours, our mind becomes utilitarian and ceases to be master.

Why teach only just one religion? Teach every religion equally or just don't and let others choose whatever religion they want to follow.,"All religions have expired as they couldn't serve the purpose of humanity.
Thousands of years and hundreds of religions couldn't give the life humans wanted.
Religions could only give birth to thousands of wars.

Religions are a stigma to human consciousness that we impose on innocent children without their acceptance.
With religions, we create confused personalities which give lifelong schizophrenia to people who couldn't come out of all that we call religion. Religion is covert programming of mind.
No religion should be taught to children and let them be as the bird on the wing.

"Why did I suddenly get a burning sensation upon my forehead and this loved one's face instantly was in my mind? Then about 5 minutes later, I have a feeling of being tired/ relaxed.","Whenever there is a keen longing for your loved one or God you will have that sensation at your third eye because the third eye is the seat of your God or loved one.
This is where you get hooked with things of your keen desire and this is not just a coincidence that you had the face of your loved one. Your love is very keen and somehow you got connected to your loved one for some time and at that time your loved one must have felt the connection also.
It is a rare connection that happens when you love someone from the bottom of your heart."
"If God already existed in absolute enlightened nondual perfection, then why did it create this imperfect world of ignorance, form & duality? Why did it go through all the trouble to try & realize enlightenment again through billions of individuals?","First of all , there is no creator as God. God is a hypothesis , there is no one to realize enlightenment through billions of individuals.
World is perfect with or without anything. It is you who is making all the assumptions of imperfection and enlightenment.
It is your mind that creates all the divisions and through divisions you are left with ignorance. This ignorance makes you seek answers to the imperfect question like this one.
Just think about it - everything is there because you are here otherwise who cares?
You never ask , “Why does the sun rise?”
You never ask, “Why do birds fly?”
You never ask, “Why is the grass green?”
Your mind doesn’t look beyond the forms, because your mind knows only division and duality."
How do you get to know your twin flame?,"The moment you come across your twin flame, you can be sure he/she is your Twin flame. He/she is either runner or chaser, runner means an illusion - a dream, a hook and chaser means sucker.

"Why strive for enlightenment if you are living in society with a partner, work, etc.?","Striving for enlightenment is the eternal striving of your consciousness to get merged into cosmic consciousness (eternity).
What you know as love, compassion, God and enlightenment are different rungs of your search for your true-self- to be one with eternity.
Your striving for enlightenment is not frivolous, it is the deepest seeking of millions of births.
Some think death is an end to this life whereas death is just like sleep at night. Each time you come to this Samsara you come with greater striving for enlightenment.
According to Buddha Nirvana is breaking out of the cycle of birth and death, cessation of the flame of desires and attachments.
Even on verge of death when someone asked Buddha, “ Will you be, beyond death?”
He said, “ No! I shall not be. I will drop out of existence like a flame that goes out.”
You will find millions of meaning in life but the eternal one is Enlightenment.

Where was consiousness existed before the formation of the universe?,"Cosmic consciousness was always there and is everywhere that is why everything was imploding into black hole Sagittarius A* before our Milky Way Galaxy originated.
The formation of the universe occurs on the law of implosion and explosion.
And
Our universe also runs on the law of implosion and explosion.
A seed is sown into the ground and the seed explodes into plant-> plant into tree -> tree again implodes into fruits -> fruit into seeds -> seeds again explode into plants and so on…..circle is completed.
Cosmic consciousness was always there and will remain there irrespective of the millions of creations and destructions of galaxies and black holes.

"How do I know if I'm serious about spirituality or just wanting an escape from my temporary problems, because spirituality needs real sincere efforts and will?","Spirituality means effortlessness. Ambitions and efforts belong to the material world.
Everything you know as spirituality is just an effort to escape from temporary problems.
You go to the Himalayas, you go to monasteries just to escape.
This world is desiring and doing and spirituality is desirelessness and non-doing.
There is nothing to do, nowhere to go, but in."
How do I convert sleep into meditation?,"This is very old Tibetan method, they have worked very deeply in the dream world and it was extensively used by George Gurdjieff.
Just before falling into sleep try to remember one unusual thing, only one thing, let's say yellow rose. Just visualize a yellow rose and go on thinking that you will see it in the dream. Visualize it and go on thinking that whatsoever the dream, this yellow rose flower will be there. Visualize its colour, scent and everything. Feel it so it will be alive in you.

Within a few days, you will be able to bring it in your dream. This is the first step, at least you have created a part of your dream.
The second step the moment you see yellow rose you will remember ‘this is a dream‘. Now yellow rose and dream are associated. Whenever the yellow rose appears you will know the dream has started. This will change the whole experience of the dream. You can enjoy the dream. If you want to stop the dream you can stop it but it will take few more days. Once you are able to start and end your dreams then you can start to create your dreams.
This techniques can work with contents (alpha state of mind) and you can be in alpha state of meditation as long as you want, but it does not work in deep sleep, because there is no content so this technique won't work with deep sleep.

Do mystics really work?,"Before I answer this question it is necessary to understand -
What is a mystic?
A mystic is enlightened but he is not yet Sadhguru or master.
Mystic is as good as an enlightened master in dealing with the energies of the body like Chakra and Kundalini.
Yes, if it comes to energies mystic can work wonders.
If you are looking for some magic wand to solve your problems of life then Mystics don't work.

What is it like to have your third eye opened? Like do you still have questions about life?,"Before opening the third eye all your questions are frivolous and lead to empty answers.
With opening of the third eye your questions become existential and lead you to fictionless life - a life beyond duality.
From your meaningless question like “what is the colour of my soul?” changes to a meaningful answer - “I know myself (soul)”.
The opening of the third eye is the realisation of the soul. It is the realisation of your ‘isness' where what remains is your presence without past and future."

Do twin flame relationships end up in marriage?,"Never,
The concept of the twin flame is self-talk or self-hypnosis. You might know about books like “Conversation with God” or “What to Say When you Talk To Yourself”.
A twin flame is based on the same concepts but Twin flame doesn’t work because it is based on the duality of mind and it depends on another living person (live wire), what starts with duality ends in vain.
You can attain peace/silence when you transcend the duality of mind. When you attain no-mind. The mind can only be noise. It doesn’t matter it is the noise of twin flame or your own.
There is no such thing as a twin flame connection or you can have a connection with yourself. You don’t need an outer hook to understand yourself.
All so-called twin flame experts live in the delusion they don’t even know what is spirituality.
They move in circles of duality and think they are on some grand mission or purpose.
Life doesn’t have any purpose. Life in itself is purpose.
What is the purpose of the Mango Tree?
To give mango to you?
No, that is how mango trees are.
You have to understand that these stars and sky, sun and moon, your dad and mom, brother and sisters are there because you are here.
Your universe starts with you and someday it will end with you but you will be the last person on earth to die after you there is nothing, no one.
Feel the gratitude for your Mother and father who made it possible for you to experience this beautiful planet we call home - earth.
Be thankful to Sun and Moon for making life possible on this planet.
There is no twin - you have come alone and you will go alone."
Can an atheist be spiritual?,"Being an atheist or theist is the same thing. Both have assumed - atheist has assumed - there is no God and theist has assumed - there is God.
Both are walking the path of ignorance whereas they have not searched for truth, neither one has concluded by experience.
When I say - there is no God - I mean God is an experience. God is not what scriptures tell you.
When I say - there is God - I mean until you experience God, don't settle on substitutes of God like idols or temples and churches.
Only the seeker of truth is said to be spiritual."
What happens to a person after enlightment. Is enlightment a state of mind?,"First the second part of the question.

Enlightenment is a superconscious state of mind where your consciousness merges into cosmic consciousness.
What happens to a person after enlightenment?
He becomes a medium for the divine to rain on people who need help to live life in joy.
He becomes responsible to spread the message of the divine.
Love is life, God is love or better yet love is god.
He shares whatsoever he has got and tell the world with compassion - what is life and what is love.
He breathes for others his heart continues to embrace the pain and sorrows of the people without discrimination.
After enlightenment, a new pilgrimage starts."
Should I follow a spiritual path instead of a successful career in the software industry?,"When it comes to choices then you should choose career in software industry.
SPIRITUALITY is not something you choose. Spirituality happens to the one who has come to know the futility of all that people run around for.
People run for power and money but some or the other way it is all about lust. If you will be at higher position you will get better match. If you will have lot of money you can buy Sex.
All that you know as life is about lust and it can never end. One more car, one more pair of shoes. Gucci, Gap and Jimmy Choo all are different names of lust. No matter how much you fill it , it will remain empty. It is more like a baseless vessel. It can never be filled.
But the day you become aware of this very fact, you become SPIRITUAL.

"Is there even a way to the end of suffering (philosophy, enlightenment, suffering, Buddhism)?","Many suns ago, maybe billions years, a man and a woman had the desire to have a kid and they made love then you are born.
Don't think you are 33–42–49 years old, you are as old as this earth. Your journey is millions of years long and it all started with a desire.
Do trees have desires? - Yes, no doubt trees do have the desire, that is how they survive. The seed becomes a tree -> tree produces fruits-> fruit again produces seeds-> seed becomes a tree again. This is what we know as a circle of life.
The very fabric of our life is the desire and it is also a source of suffering.
Desires produce more desires and attachments then this circle of life as suffering continues.

That is why Buddha's path is of desirelessness. The day you become utterly desireless you become deathless.

"If you get enlightened someday, what powers would you like to get?","Powers mean Samsar/ worldly and enlightenment is otherworldly.
If you have always known choosing and chasing then you are just the same there is no difference.
As a true seeker you should not believe in miracles. ‘Powers' is yet another ego-trip. What you seek in this world now you are seeking in divine.
Remember search for powers is not the search for enlightenment.
These siddhis/powers are the greatest obstacles on the path of enlightenment. One should keep clear of them."
How did you come to doubt your own beliefs and become a free-thinking spiritual person?,"Becoming a spiritual person in itself is more like defining boundaries.
Dropping the ‘becoming part’ of the mind is the only way to free-thinking.
Spirituality is neither in scriptures nor in knowledge.
‘Not Knowing' is the deepest state of surrendering to ‘what is’ away from what can be.
The state of ‘Not Knowing' fills you with awe and makes this world full of wonders.
AND
It allows you to start to live in NOW and the moment you start to live in now, spirituality comes dancing to you."
"If the soul is immortal, why birthday? I have never celebrated my birthday. Why do I not feel like celebrating my birthday?","There is deeper hollowness inside of you and it has nothing to do with birthday rather it has something to do with death.
You are afraid of death. You want to keep believing that you are eternal because you have assumed soul is eternal.
Even if soul is eternal but that is not your realization. You have accepted it as truth whereas it is an escape to avoid the fear of death.
This situation is cat and pigeon situation.
What you have to understand that death is happening everyday as one day is subtracted from your life everyday and you miss the opportunity to celebrate death of one year’s life every year on your b’day.

Are spiritually awakened people interested in getting in a romantic relationship?,"Awakening is all about Romantic relationships……….
Romancing with life and divorcing the death.
Or
Spiritual Awakening is all about romancing life and death also.
Relations are more or less awakening and awakening when you awake, you awake to awakening.
Awakening is how you relate to life and living.
The life you can define but living is something you have to live.
The romance you can define but romancing you have to live.
Spiritually awakened being is always interested in romancing not romance."
Who is God and where is he?,"God is everywhere because Cosmic Consciousness is everywhere.
Who is God? Is not the right question as God is not person, right question would be:-
What is that we feel as God?
I am not going to give you some poetic answer here.
Let's understand.
Humans strive for merger of self-consciousness into cosmic consciousness. This thirst to be merged into cosmic consciousness we feel as love, compassion, devotion (God) and longing for enlightenment.
*The Cosmic consciousness as defined by psychiatrist Richard Maurice Bucke, in his book Cosmic Consciousness: A Study in the Evolution of the Human Mind -
“Cosmic consciousness is higher form of consciousness than that possessed by the ordinary man.”
**In Cosmic Consciousness, Bucke stated that he discerned three forms, or degrees, of consciousness:[1]
Simple consciousness, possessed by both animals and mankind
Self-consciousness, possessed by mankind, encompassing thought, reason, and imagination
Cosmic consciousness, which is ""a higher form of consciousness than that possessed by the ordinary man""
***According to Bucke,
This consciousness shows the cosmos to consist not of dead matter governed by unconscious, rigid, and unintending law; it shows it on the contrary as entirely immaterial, entirely spiritual and entirely alive; it shows that death is an absurdity, that everyone and everything has eternal life; it shows that the universe is God and that God is the universe, and that no evil ever did or ever will enter into it; a great deal of this is, of course, from the point of view of self consciousness, absurd; it is nevertheless undoubtedly true.
This book was published in 1901 and mystics also say so from centuries.
Cosmic Consciousness is the highest form of consciousness and what we feel as God is about our longing to merge our consciousness into cosmic consciousness.
‘*’ ‘**’ ‘***’ Source: Wikipedia"
Does everybody need God?,"Absolutely no, because God is compassion and love.
If you live your life out of compassion then you become part of God.
From God's point of view, there is no evil in this world, though that sounds absurd from an individual's point of view because we have created our Gods out of our fears and fear divides.
In the name of God, we fight, wars are fought in the name of God. People are killed in the name of God.
Our God is our fear and fear creates greed, greed leads to possessiveness and possessiveness leads to ego. The ego creates boundaries, nations and sects. Sects try to prove superiority then war is inevitable.
Once we learn to live life out of compassion and forgiveness we don't need any God."
What is enlightenment? Is it a state of mind or a higher form of consciousness?,"Enlightenment is the merger of individual consciousness into cosmic consciousness.

"The 24x7 twin flame thoughts have become a waste of time, as it appears that there wouldn't be any positive outcome. Should I pursue my twin flame connection?","The concept of the twin flame is self-talk or self-hypnosis. You might know about books like “Conversation with God” or “What to Say When you Talk To Yourself”.
A twin flame is based on the same concepts but Twin flame doesn’t work because it is based on the duality of mind and it depends on another living person (live wire), what starts with duality ends in vain.
You can attain peace/silence when you transcend the duality of mind. When you attain no-mind. The mind can only be noise. It doesn’t matter it is the noise of twin flame or your own.
There is no such thing as a twin flame connection or you can have a connection with yourself. You don’t need an outer hook to understand yourself.
All so-called twin flame experts live in the delusion they don’t even know what is spirituality.
They move in circles of duality and think they are on some grand mission or purpose.
Life doesn’t have any purpose. Life in itself is purpose.
What is the purpose of the Mango Tree?
To give mango to you?
No, that is how mango trees are.
You have to understand that these stars and sky, sun and moon, your dad and mom, brother and sisters are there because you are here.
Your universe starts with you and someday it will end with you but you will be the last person on earth to die after you there is nothing, no one.
Feel the gratitude for your Mother and father who made it possible for you to experience this beautiful planet we call home - earth.
Be thankful to Sun and Moon for making life possible on this planet.
There is no twin - you have come alone and you will go alone."
Can being stuck  in life be a spiritual issue?,"‘Being stuck' is the most un-spiritual attitude towards life.
People come to me with problems and 99 times out of 100 the problem they are assumed to be facing is their unwillingness to change or rather they make a hill out of a mole.
What I have found is they get stuck at one of two reasons - they can't forgive and they remain stuck to the past or they are so afraid of death that they don't live life.
Lesson No. 1: Forgive everyone without discrimination and forgive yourself first, if you don't forgive yourself then there is no point in declaring your forgiveness.
Lesson No. 2: Death will come and take away everything you have, so everything that you have belongs to death. Life is all about learning to die gracefully it is not about life in itself. Once you understand death you start to live life in its totality. You come to know life is always ‘here and now' not ‘there and then'. Suddenly, you are filled with gratitude for whatsoever you have. You will find there are thousands of lives to live. You start to enjoy life.
These are two ‘being stuck(s)' and all other blockages are because of a lack of understanding of these two truths.
Remember life happens and dying gracefully is a choice.

"To the enlightened: when enlightenment is not the end of spirituality, what do you do to proceed further spiritually from enlightenment? Do all enlightened beings progress at the same speed from enlightenment spiritually?","We enter on a rare pilgrimage after enlightenment.
I happened to read ‘The Ten Bulls of Zen' by Kakuan which is something unique in the history of human consciousness. Truth has been expressed in many ways, and it has always been found that it remains unexpressed whatsoever you do. It simply escapes description. The ‘Ten Bulls of Zen' by Kakuan have tried in a single effort to express the inexpressible.

The first eight bulls came from Taoism and two were added by Zen master Kakuan.
These two bulls represent the journey after enlightenment. The eighth bull represents enlightenment.
9th bull says ‘life is a goal'. Now one knows thoughts, dreams and reality are not different there is no distinction because no-mind can't distinguish.
You understand religion is mean not end. Religion is to make you happy not repressed. Happiness is Advaita- non-dual - your very nature. Your mind is misery and no-mind is peace. Life is only happiness. Happiness is climate.
Spread happiness by helping people to come out of mind. You have found new goal.
Tenth Bull:- (returning to society) I go to the market place again with my bottle of wine and return home with my staff (disciples). Why one should follow the footprints of patriarchs?
People need your help to be happy. Now everybody is enlightened for you. Love them equally.
Answer the question:-
What is this life? If death comes and takes it, what is this life? What meaning does it carry if one is so impotent against death?
Remember, after birth everybody is on his deathbed. There is no other way. All beds are deathbeds because after birth only one thing is certain, and that is death.
The search for the enlightenment is the search for a real-life, authentic life, which knows no death.

How does it make your twin flame runner feel when you finally stop chasing and ignore them?,"He can come back the moment you want him back……..
Because it is all about self-talk. It is the same like you talk to your God.
The essence can be found in many spiritual practices.
A twin flame is the lowest rung of spirituality and most of the time it ends in vain.
The reason is this concept starts with another person and our search for peace is directed outward and silence is inside.
The so-called runner is elusive and always keeps you confused and in confusion, one doesn't find peace.
As famous French philosopher Jean Paul Sartre said,
“Hell is Other People.” so is your so-called runner.

What is the method of doing meditation for 24 hours?,"Meditation is mean not the end.
Restlessness is the very nature of the mind. The mind can be anywhere but not in present.
Meditation is something beyond the mind. Mind is doing and meditation is non-doing. Meditation can help you reduce your erratic thoughts. But still, thoughts will remain.
Meditation is one and crucial part of the inner work. Meditation alone can not ensure inner peace.
If meditation is making you a bit silent then meditation is not working on you.
Meditation should shake you, it should give you a dark night of the soul.
Inner peace can not be ascertained till your mind remains. It will be one day peaceful other day hell.
Inner alchemy happens when you attain no-mind.
I totally disagree with people who keep meditating for decades. They have not worked on inner transformation. They have missed the point.
The only purpose of meditation is to transcend meditation when your life becomes a meditation. You don't sit even for 5 minutes to attain inner peace. Inner peace prevails in every moment of life. Meditation happens in every moment of life.
Your walking is meditation, your eating is meditation and your sleeping is meditation. You become a meditation."
Shall anyone whose life is completely destroyed by someone take revenge on him/her or go for half-hearted Spirituality? Can anyone give practical reasons?,"He should take revenge and remember best revenge is SUCCESS.
SPIRITUALITY is not something you go for. Spirituality happens to the one who has come to know the futility of all that people run around for.
People run for power and money but some or the other way it is all about lust. If you will be at higher position you will get better match. If you will have lot of money you can buy Sex.

Do we have any control over improving the illusory dream while we are in it or is it better to just awaken from the dream?,"‘Improving’ is word of achieving mind. Your mind keeps you inside that dream by achieving this and that.
Everything that belongs to mind will land you into dream. You can't control mind by mind.
Your ego is main character of that dream. You can't control the dream but of course you can annihilate the dream by annihilating your ‘ego'.
Your dream is only skin deep as your ego is shifting sands. All you have to do is to disidentify from ego and become a witness of that dream.
Once you find witness inside of you, you will merge into witness of this universe we know as God."
What meditation technique should one follow to realise the highest truth?,"Surprisingly, there is only one meditation like there is one sleep but we have many dreams.
Meditation is the only thing we know beyond mind. Meditation belongs to No-mind.
All thousand and one so-called meditation(s) are just methods to enter meditation. All methods belong to mind.
Marcus Aurelius wrote book meditations. There is no equivalent word to Dhyan ,only word that comes close to Dhyan is meditation (there is no such thing as meditations) in English.
The ultimate alchemy that happens on enlightenment has seeds in meditation. We have three states of mind - waking, dreaming and sleeping. Fourth is not state it is our nature called Turiya. Turiya has something of waking and something of sleeping. Sleeping not in the way we know. Sleeping means state of no-mind. What we know as witnessing in meditation is seed of Turiya. Once you attain the state of no-mind permanently- pure consciousness, all your questions become answers.
Witnessing is the only meditation and you can witness your breathing, your thoughts or your emotions. When you witness your thoughts, there will be gaps between the thoughts and when you keep meditating for years these gaps become larger and larger and one fine day one of the gaps will become permanent and you will enter state of no-mind.
One step more you will enter Samadhi.
Turiya is permanent Samadhi."
How can you explain silence?,"Karma, knowledge and devotion belong to noise.
Even God is a noise regardless of God of form or formless God. Your prayers are noise.
Karma, knowledge and devotion are doing and silence belongs to non-doing.
These are games of mind and silence belongs to no-mind.
Like darkness is absence of light , silence is absence of noise.
Silence is emptiness, which is limitless and boundless.

Did you know that infinite love & infinite knowledge are innate qualities to the human Soul?,"Yes, you are absolutely right. Infinite love & knowledge are innate qualities of human soul.
But very few have realization of the soul. Soul is just another word for them. Only the person who has experienced the death could have had glimpses of the soul. Because in NDE (Near Death Experiences) your ego dissolves.
As George Gurdjieff used to say one has to realize that he is caged then he can think of liberation.
Most of the people are never born they just die. Most of the people only know words like God and soul but they don't have realization of God and soul.
Once you are liberated and realize your soul you become limitless, boundless.

Why is the past not?,"We keep living our present based on the past and time is just a concept and especially the past because everything is borne out of present.
Past and future never happen and present is the eternity that is where life happens.
Mind is past, mind is future but the mind is not present.
Mind is time:- You are as old as this earth and the concept of time is more or less equally old.
The concept of time is deeper than the concept of God. It is in your DNA, blood and bone marrow. The last thing that drops before awakening is the concept of time and the moment concept of time is dropped you return to the present permanently.
Thus past is not.

"While meditating, do I need to focus on my belly as an example or just be aware of it? By aware I mean just sit with closed eyes and feel my belly moving.","Concentration is not meditation. Concentration is required in science. You keep knowing more of lesser and lesser.
Focusing is not meditation.
Contemplation is not meditation. Contemplation is required in art like poetry and painting etc.
There is a duality because there is a subject (you) and an object (you are focusing on).
What is consciousness?
Consciousness = Conscious mind (focusing faculty) + awareNESS (observing faculty).
What is the purpose of meditation?
Meditation doesn't belong to mind. Meditation belongs to pure consciousness aka awareness.
The purpose of meditation is to transcend duality of mind and reaching awareness where you become a witness forever or you merge with the witness of this universe we know as God (existence).
Meditation is witnessing, in other words, the mind is doing and meditation is non-doing. Mind is to choose, meditation is to be choiceless.

Why do people get mad? Is it really a mental problem or a spiritual problem?,"While working with people I have found madness is based on fear.
There are generally three kinds of fears - 1) Fear of death or uncertainty 2) Fear of going mad and 3) fear of premature ejaculation.
Sometimes when fear of uncertainty takes over your mind it creates a thinking loop. If that thinking loop is not short circuited then it takes over the nervous system. Due to the prolonged persistence of the thinking loop madness is created and reinforced with time.
Spirituality can help one to understand the fear of death and it does help in preventing madness in the person.
Remember -All fears originate from fear of death."
"Does exercise (running, weights) hold you back spiritually (enlightenment) being in the present?","No, rather exercise will prepare you for enlightenment. In fact, running and weight training help you to remain in the present moment otherwise 140Kg bar can fall on your chest and can crush your chest.
Enlightenment requires a good healthy athletic body and heart. When the changes in the brain happen brain needs a good supply of blood and there are two ways to supply blood 1) Shirsh Asana 2) By pumping your heart faster. It is much like brain surgery and in that case, your heart should be athletic, it should be able to bear heartbeat up to 160 BPM for a prolonged time. Brain changes happen when you sleep or dream.
Weight Training will open your Muladhara Chakra but you will have to train your lower body heavily with Deadlifts, Lunges and squats. This will help you open your first two chakras or first psychic knot (Brahma Granthi).
You should understand all the possibilities of enlightenment start with your body and healthy eating will also add to the chances of your enlightenment.
Cut the sugar to nil, eat things of good cholesterol, avoid fried food, eat egg whites.
Enlightenment has nothing to do with religiousness if you follow the path of knowledge (Gyan Marg). But everything I said will become absurd if you follow the path of devotion (Bhakti Marg).
PS: Strictly, Non-veg you will have to avoid as that will cause blockage of the heart chakra. The very idea of killing something will not allow compassion to flow through you and forget about eating dead things. For Proteins, you can have sprouts, beans egg whites and tofu."
How do enlightened individuals continue with the disciplining of their children after enlightenment?,"First of all, enlightenment is impossible to someone with a family and especially kids.
Buddha can't happen twice.
Awakening is possible but enlightenment is just next to impossible.
Now your question is no more relevant but my answer is :-
What is the difference between self-realisation (Awakening) and enlightenment :-
What you know as ‘I' is mind's ‘I'.
There is false-self as an ‘EGO'. There is duality.There is subject and object also.
When duality of mind's ‘I’ dissolves - it is called self-realisation.
When dew drop realises itself, it is self-realisation.
When existence merges into your being that is called enlightenment.
When Ocean merges into dew drop , it is called enlightenment.
In other words - when the sixth chakra(Ajna chakra) opens then you realise your nondual self and that is called self-realisation or Awakening and when the 7th - Sahasrara Chakra + 8th-Bindu Chakra and 9th -Talu chakra open then it is called enlightenment.

What is the difference between attained and created spirituality and awakening? Why do people create the false attainment of these highly revered states?,"As Adyashanti puts it:-

What causes Muladhara (root chakra) damaging and deactivation? What are the symptoms and how to heal it?,"Straight to the point:-
Symptoms:-
Skin problems and severe itching all over the body.
Damaging Reasons:-
Pornography, over indulgence in sex.
And remember opening of the chakra never happens one by one. It happens in pairs.
Your first chakra is male and the second chakra is female. The third chakra is male and the fourth is female. The fifth chakra is male and the sixth chakra is female.
The seventh chakra (Sahasrara Chakra) is neither male nor female - it is the end of the duality.
When root chakra (Muladhara chakra) meets Sacral Hara chakra (Svadhisthana chakra) then Brahma Granthi (First Psychic Knot) opens and energy moves to Solar Plexus Chakra ( Manipura Chakra) - Manipura Chakra meets Heart Chakra ( Anahata Chakra) and Vishnu Granthi (Second Psychic Knot) opens and energy moves to Vishuddha Chakra ( Throat Chakra) - And lastly, Vishuddha Chakra (male) meets Ajna Chakra (Third eye) and Rudra Granthi (Third Psychic Knot) opens finally energy moves to 7th Chakra - Sahasrara Chakra - This is known as divine orgasm with existence.
This is the end of Maya - duality - The Nirvana, Moksha, Kaivalya, Anal - Haq or Fana.
Remember:- first meeting happens in a sleep state so you don't know about it only visible symptoms appear like skin problems.
The second meeting happens in a dream state you notice that like a dream but you can't control it.
The third meeting happens in a waking state - not only you are aware of it but also you can control your urges in it.
And when energy reaches Sahasrara Chakra - Turiya - the Samadhi happens.
This is the sun ascension of Kundalini.
This is a male Ascension.
This produces Krishna like personality.
Another ascension is the moon ascension where the first chakra meets the fourth chakra, the second chakra meets the fifth and the third chakra meets the sixth chakra.
This produces Buddha like personality.
This is also called female ascension.
Layout of chakras also changes in female Ascension.
Your first chakra is female and the second chakra is male. The third chakra is female and the fourth is male. The fifth chakra is female and the sixth chakra is male.
And remember you are half male and half female. That is why Ardhnarishvar.

How does the self dissolve when I don't try seeking enlightenment? How does the realization happen if one isn't allowed to desire it?,"When I say, “Enlightenment is just around the corner”.
That means seeking has to be started. There is golden rules or step by step procedure. There are weapons and triggers but only a few could unleash the power of those weapons because weapons are lethal.
You’ve gotta start seeking.
And remember, lukewarm desire will not do. It should be all or nothing. It should be matter of life and death.
When I say, “You are already enlightened.”
That means seeking has to be annihilated. I try to short-circuit your seeking loop.
All your desires have to be annihilated.
This part is tricky because it happens rarely and sometimes it never happens. People keep the desire of being enlightened all their life or people choose a substitute meaning of Enlightenment. And some realize there is no method to attain enlightenment. They deny enlightenment altogether. Now desire of enlightenment is also gone.
And
Enlightenment happens in the state of utter desirelessness.
When your last desire to be desireless drops.
You become enlightened.

Can you feel your twin flame runner going through their dark night of the soul?,"No, runner means an illusion - a dream, a hook.
So-called Runner enjoys his/ her life and the chaser keeps dreaming and screaming.
To be clear the whole concept is an illusion or fiction.
Young girls and boys come to me with their horror stories of the twin flame.
In one of the stories, a beautiful girl fell in love with a guy and wasted 4 years and at the end of the day ‘Guy' (so-called runner) turned out to be GAY. She thought her love was divine because it was devoid of sexual relationships and one of the well-known twin flame experts kept telling her - this is sacred and divine love.
So-called twin flame experts are more like African Ghanaian Con Artists or better yet to say they also live an illusion.
Nothing can be true in duality (twin)- it is like a weak ego chasing a strong ego. A runner doesn't give a damn and the chaser keeps moving in circles. A twin flame is a stigma, a hurdle to the expansion of human consciousness.

Can I be a punk but also spiritual?,"Be Punk but utterly truthful to yourself.
Spirituality is for rebels and contradictions are the key to spiritual awakening.
Spirituality has nothing to do with being ‘YES BOY'. Learn to say ‘NO'. Define your boundaries and never allow trespassing. Be ready with a fighter jet (F-16 Block 70/72) and bomb (Preferably Atom Bomb) and drop it whenever required.
All your life you just want lovey-dovey of life.
And
When life shakes you - you turn spiritual. If here in spirituality also you keep expecting the same comforts then you better go back to the world of Life Insurance.
Until and unless you are ready to be shaken to your very core you will not awake.
Your sleep is millions of years old and you need very zigzag treatment now.
If you decide to awake then be ready to be shaken.
YOU will tremble thousands and one time and in millions of ways because your mind will be changed like river moulds the rocks. The umbilical cord needs to be cut and pain has to be endured there is no other way.
Spiritual awakening is ‘death and resurrection'.

I have a question for all meditators. If we reach the state of Samadhi after long practice will this induce high amounts of dopamine in my brain? Will it be dangerous like scientists say? Can it lead to serious health problems?,"Not a single person can reach Samadhi with this question in mind, because Samadhi is grand death and this question reflects fear of death.
What happens in death exactly happens in Samadhi. One who enters Samadhi never returns. Samadhi is like a black hole, where time and space changes forever. One who returns is not the same person not the one who went into Samadhi.
If you are planning to enter Samadhi then start collecting wood logs for your pyre.
Samadhi means Maha Mrityu (Grand Death) - Death of ‘EGO'.

"What does ""you are not your thoughts"" mean?","You are your thoughts, you are your emotions, you are your body.
Until you are your mind. Until you keep identified with mind's ‘I' aka ‘EGO'.
What is identification?
There is the degree of identification with the mind's “I” and its activities it can be observed without awakening/enlightenment.
Watching a movie is a good example of being completely identified and ironing your shirt or hanging your clothes out to dry aren’t the activities that you become so taken up with that you forget everything else. These are different levels of identification.
We can think of identification as ‘about attention'. When you are present, attention is divided between yourself ( subject) and the object of your observation, with identification attention, is drawn by the object of attention. The intensity of identification can be determined by your fascination for the object of attention.
e.g. If someone is smashing your friend's car windscreen and if someone is smashing the windscreen of your car. The difference will be of identification. You will get identified with your car but not your friend's car.
In the case of a friend's car, you will have distance and you stand as a WITNESS.
But the fact is you can remain disidentified in case of your car also. That is what is meant by being a witness.
The identification limits our understanding of ourselves and of the world.
Be a witness, don't analyse.

How long does it take to get enlightened?,"Enlightenment can happen right here, right now.
The moment all the wanderings of your mind stop and you acknowledge WITNESS inside of you, you become enlightened.
You are already enlightened, but you don't realize that because you are always somewhere and enlightenment is always now and here.
Your question has already taken you away from enlightenment.
Your desire to be extraordinary takes you everywhere - around the world.
And enlightenment is about being ordinary. Being ordinary is the most extraordinary state of being.
The ego wants to be extraordinary no matter where the ego is it will find ways to be special, incomparable.
If you can't become Jeff Bezos then become Buddha.
People go to monasteries, people go to the Himalayas. People wear white clothes to look ordinary but these are also the ways to look special.
Because ‘ego' is always there and ‘enlightenment' is always here.
When you live ordinary by eating when you feel hungry, drinking water when you are thirsty and sleeping when you feel sleepy, your ego dissolves.
Just be as natural as birds and trees and suddenly everything will start happening in all its glory.
There is absolutely nothing that needs to be done, nowhere to go to be enlightened.

Is spiritual awakening pseudoscience?,"God, Soul and reincarnation are pseudoscience or it is better to say devices.
But ‘enlightenment' is 100% true or in fact, the only true thing is ‘enlightenment' in spirituality.
People are yet to realise that nothing on earth is permanent but you can live a deathless life.’ Enlightenment' is the taste of deathlessness.
When I say, “ You are already enlightened.” This is a device to short-circuit your seeking.
When I say, “ Enlightenment is here and now.” This is a device to put you in the present moment.
When I say, “Enlightenment is just around the corner”. This is a device to get you started.
When I say, “You will have to reincarnate millions of times before you get enlightened.” I am just stretching your longing for liberation/enlightenment.
When I say, “ Soul is immortal”. This is just to make you feel there is something eternal in you.
When I say, “There is no God.” I am making you utterly helpless by removing your wooden leg so that you seek.
Whatsoever you hear in spirituality are devices to make you immortal, enlightened and deathless.
And
‘Enlightenment' happens when enlightenment, truth, God, soul all become meaningless; when not a single hook remains. Then something happens like the falling of a morning star or the falling of a leaf from a tree, with that you become nothing, and out of nothingness, you become everything."
How is finding yourself more about an unlearning of all these things that aren’t the true you? How is finding yourself more about returning to your authentic self?,"Mind is great in learning but it is even better and more powerful in unlearning things.
That’s what is enlightenment about.
The conscious mind has limited memory but the subconscious mind has unlimited memory and it stores everything in terms of experiences.
The problem is not memories, the problem is your identification with them and thus you remain miserable.
On enlightenment, your mind’s “I” aka “ego” dissolves into existence and there remains this existence as “self “. Simultaneously your ‘self ‘ gets dis-identified from your memories. You unlearn to identify with the mind’s “I” or “ego”. Now when you look back at your past it seems like a boring movie.
Surprisingly, it happens like a sudden clash of thunder. What we know as a miracle is quite the nature of us.
Enlightenment is our true-nature, which knows nothing else but the present."
Can you remove memories from your conscience?,"Absolutely “YES” , mind is great in learning but it is even better and more powerful in unlearning things.

Is it possible to get enlightenment in about 1 month or less?,"Absolutely Yes,
Sudden enlightenment is the concept of Zen traditions.
But this answer should be about you, not enlightenment.
People escape from efforts and their desire to be extraordinary puts such questions.
And enlightenment is about being ordinary. Being ordinary is the most extraordinary state of being.
The ego wants to be extraordinary no matter where the ego is it will find the ways to be special, incomparable.
If you can't become Jeff Bezos then become Buddha.
People go to monasteries, people go to the Himalayas. People wear white clothes to look ordinary but these are also the ways to look special.
Because ‘ego' is always there and ‘enlightenment' is always here.
When you live ordinary by eating when you feel hungry, drinking water when you are thirsty and sleeping when you feel sleepy , your ego dissolves.
Just be as natural as birds and trees and suddenly everything will start happening in all its glory. There is absolutely nothing that is needed to be enlightened.

"If the mind and ego are just illusions, then who is the one who strives for enlightenment?","If ‘enlightenment' is a fancy idea then it is your ‘ego' striving for enlightenment.
If ‘suffering’ is the trigger then ‘enlightenment’ is a need for survival and it is your soul crying for survival.
If you seek enlightenment as a doer then it is the ego that seeks enlightenment.
If you search for meaning of yourself then ‘enlightenment' is just a by-product.
You can achieve anything but you can never achieve enlightenment.
Achievements and goals are worldly and enlightenment is otherworldly.
Enlightenment happens in the utter state of desirelessness.
When the last desire to be desireless also drops you become non-being.
When you become non-being then you become everything and that everything is ‘enlightenment'.

"If, according to 'enlightened' adherents of advaita vedanta, all is one, there is no you, etc., why do they bother answering questions at all? If no one is asking and no one is answering, who exactly do they think they're talking to?","All is one as an Awareness and there are many as a consciousness.
We are one as energy and we are separate as organisms.
“The universe is an expansion of energy, and life is the crystallisation of that energy.
What we see as stones, is also energy, what we see as thoughts, consciousness and life is also a form of energy.
The whole cosmos - whether waves in the ocean, leaf on a tree, grain of sand or the stars in the sky or what is within us- all are manifestations of the same energy in infinite forms.”
When Krishna says “I”, he doesn't use “I” as an ‘EGO' he has to use “I” as utilitarian. This is a limitation of our language. But if you can see behind Krishna's “I” you will see emptiness, utter emptiness, there is no ‘ego'.
Don't confuse your ‘I' and enlightened being's “I”.

"Can a person who ever had an enlightenment experience prove that the experience is not simply a brain effect? If the experience was from another dimension, how can he/she remember it in the brain?","Absolutely YES, in fact, you too can taste the enlightenment.
The only thing an enlightened person can give to others is his presence and his presence will light up your soul like thousand suns.
Even the birds and animals feel the silence of enlightened beings.
It is like a piece of sky walking on the earth.
But unfortunately, the question is from the mind and to feel the silence of enlightened being you don't need to ask questions, you just need to feel the presence, you just need an innocent heart.
You just need to flow with it, glow with it.

What is at the core of suffering?,"Many suns ago, maybe billions years, a man and a woman had the desire to have a kid and they made love then you are born.
Don't think you are 30–40–49 years old, you are as old as this earth. Your journey is millions of years long and it all started with a desire.
Do trees have desires? - Yes, no doubt trees do have the desire, that is how they survive. The seed becomes a tree -> tree produces fruits-> fruit again produces seeds-> seed becomes a tree again. This is what we know as a circle of life.
The very fabric of our life is the desire and it is also a source of suffering.
Desires produce more desires and attachments then this circle of life as suffering continues.

That is why Buddha's path is of desirelessness. The day you become utterly desireless you become deathless.
Here is the incident just before Buddha’s enlightenment.
Buddha’s master said, “You have to move on. I am not master, just a teacher. Whatever I told you is not my experience. I just repeated what I read in scriptures. I was pretending and I am very sorry!”
Buddha was totally shattered and tired.
He went to take a bath in a nearby river, Niranjana. It is a very small river; in the summer it is not even one foot deep. And he was taking a bath, but he was so weak that he could not cross that small current. He had to hang onto a branch of a tree for a few moments to gather some energy so that he could get out of the river. He felt like cheated in the name of enlightenment.
That experience made it clear to him there is no enlightenment.
Though denying to be real master can only be claimed by the real master, according to me Buddha’s master was real courageous master who declared himself charlatan.
Buddha’s last hook of attachment and of desire to be enlightened disappeared in one stroke.
His enlightenment came out of desirelessness and anybody who’s seeking has ended can become enlightened.

"Is your true self, your higher self, and I am presence the same thing or different? How can you connect with all three?","Your consciousness is a subset of your awareness. Your awareness is as vast as this existence because awareness is the fabric of our Universe. But your consciousness is limited to your mind's ‘I' aka ‘ego'.
True-self and higher-self are also known as soul. These are mind's inferencing faculty in absolute reality. Because of their direct communion with absolute truth (absolute reality), these are very intuitive and accurate also as there is no interference of the fictional part of the conscious mind this faculty of mind holds the mysteries of the universe.
The highest consciousness is cosmic consciousness.
When awareness moves deeper then Consciousness moves to superconsciousness and finally to cosmic consciousness.
It happens like this when your awareness goes to subconscious mind -> unconscious mind --> collective unconscious mind --> cosmic unconscious mind simultaneously your consciousness moves to superconsciousness --> collective consciousness --> cosmic consciousness.

When one becomes enlightened he merges into existence and becomes existence himself.

"Is it really possible to reach enlightenment, or is it just a false ideal?","Everything -soul, reincarnation and God are just devices - but enlightenment is real.
In fact, the only thing real in spirituality is ‘enlightenment'.
Enlightenment means bringing the light in so that darkness doesn't remain.
As you can't do anything to darkness directly but you can disperse the darkness by bringing the light similarly darkness of your mind can only be removed by the light of right knowing (mind you, I said ‘knowing', not knowledge).
This is what Buddha meant by saying “Appo Deepo Bhava”—'be your own light'.
Kabir explained this in very simple terms. It is paraphrased as: “Just as the oil of the sesame is in the small sesame grain, just as the fire is there in the flint stone, so also is your divine, your enlightenment in you. All you need is to awaken yourself.” That is: Be your own light.
Enlightenment is your true nature.
That is why it is said, “You are already enlightened”.

What are the basic steps on the spiritual path? I heard the path is not for the faint-hearted.,"Be selfish and utterly truthful to yourself.
The spiritual path is full of paradoxes.
Spirituality has nothing to do with being ‘YES BOY'. Learn to say ‘NO'. Define your boundaries and never allow trespassing. Be ready with a fighter jet (F-16 Block 70/72) and bomb (Preferably Atom Bomb) and drop it whenever required.
Spirituality is for rebels and contradictions are the key to spiritual awakening.
All your life you just want lovey-dovey of life.
And
When life shakes you - you turn spiritual. If here in spirituality also you keep expecting the same comforts then you better go back to the world of Life Insurance.
Until and unless you are shaken to your core you will not awake.
Your sleep is millions of years old and you need very zigzag treatment now.
If you decide to awake then be ready to be shaken.
YOU will tremble thousands and one time and in millions of ways because your mind will be changed like river moulds the rocks. The umbilical cord needs to be cut and pain has to be endured there is no other way.
Spiritual awakening is ‘death and resurrection'.

"Why according to Ramana Maharshi ""nothing really happened""?","We keep living our present based on the past and time is just a concept and especially the past because everything is borne out of present.
Past and future never happen and present is the eternity that is where life happens.
Mind is past, mind is future but the mind is not present.
Mind is time:-
You are as old as this earth and the concept of time is more or less equally old.
The concept of time is deeper than the concept of God. It is in your DNA, blood and bone marrow.
The last thing that drops before awakening is the concept of time and the moment concept of time is dropped you return to the present permanently.
Thus nothing really happened.
LIVE HERE AND NOW.

How do I reach the highest spiritual consciousness and awareness?,"The highest consciousness is cosmic consciousness.
When awareness moves deeper then Consciousness moves to superconsciousness and finally to cosmic consciousness.
It happens like this when your awareness goes to subconscious mind -> unconscious mind --> collective unconscious mind --> cosmic unconscious mind simultaneously your consciousness moves to superconsciousness --> collective consciousness --> cosmic consciousness.

Now the tricky part:-
How do you reach there?
This is a matter of paradox because you can't reach there but you can attain it by emptying your mind by non-doing.
Learn the art of non-doing.
That is why I say if mind is doing then meditation is non-doing.
Just be a witness.

"Does an open third eye mean that everything you see is right and true? Should we rely on them, or is there a possibility of manipulation either from evil beings or your own thoughts?","The third eye is the sixth chakra and on the opening of the third eye, you reach absolute truth.
But the inference of the mind is still required to make decisions. Mind won't have any fictional content after opening of the third eye. Here you enter the no-mind state.
This is far beyond good or evil, happiness and sorrows, friends and enemies. This is a state of ‘isness'.
To be grounded you need to remain witness otherwise you will fall into clutches of the duality of life. That is where you lose your truth.
But otherwise, you will be able to see through truth and lie easily.

"Formerly, Osho said that enlightenment makes you more vulnerable to diseases and sickness, is this true and why? Why was Ramana Maharshi healthy in spite of being ill?","Ramana Maharishi died of cancer because he had the habit of chewing betel nut.
Enlightenment makes one vulnerable because of changes in physiology as the energy starts to travel upward the whole-body energy system changes.
Usually, the energy in the body travels downward to the sex centre and that is how we live all our life but on enlightenment, the energy travels upward to the highest centre of our consciousness that is Sahasrara Chakra.
The gravity of the earth pulls the energy downward but on enlightenment, the energy is pulled upwards by the gravitational pull of the moon. After mergence with existence, you become an ocean, you become existence. It is unlikely that whatever affects existence like the moon, sun and all other planets will not affect you. Though they affect everybody but enlightened being notices them because of his cosmic consciousness. He is well aware of the hidden mysteries of existence.
The energy is the same but the quality of energy changes to a lighter form. That is how some of enlightened beings could levitate and that is how Jesus could walk on the water.
Our lower body which is supposed to be strong becomes weaker with time after enlightenment. This may sound absurd but YES after enlightenment, one becomes weak physically.
One more factor that contributes to weakness is food - after enlightenment, one can't have a protein-based diet as that will hamper the upwards travel of the energy causing psychological problems and in the absence of protein body becomes weak.
And non-veg food becomes impossible to eat after enlightenment because that causes blockage in the heart chakra causing psychological problems like hallucinations and reality layers overlap. It is the purity of the body that doesn't allow one to even think of destroying any form of life.
With all goods, there is some bad news also but I want to make sure you should know the negatives of enlightenment before you take a plunge into uncharted waters.

How do I overcome a third eye pressure headache?,"What you think as third eye pressure is not actually the pressure due to activity in the third eye.
Any blockage below the sixth chakra (third eye) will strain the brain area which is connected to the third eye.
e.g. If there is blockage at the root chakra because of overthinking about sex or repressing sex urge it will create pressure at the third eye area and Crown Area.
If there is blockage at the third chakra (Solar plexus chakra) because of ‘ego' issues it will create pressure at the third eye area.
Most of the people think if the location of pressure is third eye then third eye is about to open. People perform Trataka meditation for decades without any luck of opening the third eye. Third eye is not opened by Trataka meditation, it can only give you pressure and headaches - because Trataka means gazing and by gazing you are moving away from the meditation as meditation means non-doing. Gazing is doing.
To relax your third eye you need to simplify your life and live life in the present moment. Transform your negative emotions to positive ones. Share only positive things with people. Understand your ego.

"What is the shaktipat? Why do some fully realized teachers not give it, whereas some not fully realized teachers are able to give it?","Shaktipat is performed on initiation of disciple but it is misunderstood by people that initiation can happen just by finding the right Guru.
It takes years before disciple is initiated by Shaktipat. Shaktipat requires total surrender, which happens after years of association with the right master. In sufi tradition initiation by shaktipat happens after 5–6 years of association with master.
There are two initiations:-
1) When the disciple surrenders his/her past to master.
2) When the surrender of the disciple is completed and this is the point when Shaktipat happens.
Shaktipat can't be delivered also it happens on when surrender of disciple and egoless master as medium meet. Shaktipat requires egoless medium (Enlightened Master/ Guru) hence if somebody says he can deliver Shaktipat, be wary of him.
An egoless medium can't claim to deliver Shaktipat. Shaktipat happens in the great communion between Divine-Master-Disciple.

Why does meditating not work most of the time?,"BECAUSE meditation is non-doing. How can non-doing work?
The very nature of meditation is not to work.
Meditation means nothing to do and nowhere to go.
Just be……….here and now.
Whenever you think in terms of work and doing, mediation becomes absurd.
Our mind is full of noise or our mind is noise because the mind is ‘doing'.
The mind fills its emptiness by thousand and one thing we know as ‘LIFE'. The mind keeps emptying and filling. Filling and emptying is the nature of existence.
Beyond the mind there is emptiness.
If Mind is ‘doing’ then meditation is ‘non-doing'.
Only by non-doing, you can reach emptiness and emptiness is silence, stillness and peace.

"Nothing is predestined and our action creates a lot of possibilities of our life sequence/outcomes. How is it different from surrendering to God, kind of no action?","LIFE is neither predestined nor the outcome of your actions.
Life happens.
Surrendering to God frees you from the worries of the future. You start to feel gratitude for what you have. You start to live in present.
But surrendering to God should be unconditional.
The problem arises when we curse God for all the bad that happens and we give credit to ourselves for all that good that happens.
This is hypocrisy and most of the people don't surrender to God, they want a scapegoat and God is a scapegoat for most of the people.
Poor God can't even complain and you keep putting all your ugly shortcomings on god by praying and your prayers are not more than cursing. This is exploitation of helpless God.
You curse life, you curse God, you curse yourself because you don't know the meaning of life.
Your understanding of life is very limited.
And understanding and balance of life come from living life in all its dimensions. Life is bitter and sweat also, laughter and tears also. One who doesn’t know how to cry , he can’t know how to laugh. One who doesn’t enjoy laughter, his tears will be crocodile tears. Don't choose one thing against other.
Live life in its totality.

Is it possible to have started the process of Kundalini awakening years ago without knowing it?,"Absolutely YES, in fact, this is what happens with everybody - they don't realize that the journey of kundalini had started decades ago.
I know people struggling for decades because they just don't change or they run from one spiritual experience to another having a distinct ego of being divine.
I always tell them that they are having BAD experiences not spiritual experiences.
There is a difference.
Here is a real thing:- when kundalini travels then awakening of the first two chakras happens in a sleep state (totally unconscious) and awakening of 3rd and 4th chakras happens in the dream state, it happens like a dream the awakening of 5th and 6th chakra happens in waking state, this is where your third eye opens and the vision of world changes in a burst.
Unfortunately, people don't know and spend their whole life in the lower 3 chakras and keep taking medicines without knowing the real cause of their psychological and health problems.
Kundalini awakening is a natural process of transformation. But when we say ‘No' to life we block our chakras.
I have met many people whose chakras are blocked. Most of the people have a hard time unblocking their heart chakra because of the lack of trust and surrender. They live their life in doubts and only doubts. They keep moving in the circles shifting their preference between desires of things and persons and that is why they have little to no possibility of transforming their life.
Kundalini is always there, kundalini is the life-force and what you know as death is the withdrawal of kundalini and LIFE is all about opening of chakras and keeping them balanced.

Is it spiritual awakening when you’re losing all emotion?,"Yes, this is one of the stages of spiritual awakening known as CHAOS of Life and doctors call it depression, Acute stress disorder (ASD) and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).
Though you can't acknowledge the stages of awakening but the day you come to know about ‘Dark Night of the Soul’ the perceptions of your dilemma change and that gives you a new direction.
There is a universal law:- The moment you become aware of something you become the controller of it otherwise you remain a victim.
This stage is primarily called CHAOS when Life shakes you with the death of a loved one or divorce or breakup, then “Goodbye” is hardest word to say and you fall to CHAOS, where you try to disidentify from what people know as ‘LIFE' or you tend to lose all your emotions.
The meaning of life is changing. The meaning of relations is changing. The meaning of your identity is changing.
Your emotions are freezing.
You will come to this stage many times in your life but never bother to transcend this stage and you decide to remain in your comfort zone.
Warning: Here you can become a VICTIM of TWIN-FLAME and Tantra Groups.
If you remain aware you transcend to the NEXT stage DEATH.
——————STAGE DEATH———————
This Stage is the most difficult one and it can last for months or years or maybe you never transcend this stage. Doctors call it Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD).
*—Dark Night of the Soul —*
The first time it was mentioned as ‘Dark Night of the Soul’ by 16th-century Spanish mystic St. John of the Cross in his poem.
You have become emotionless and immune to life and its absurdities. You become non-being.
You will have many COMPLEX-PTSD attacks during this stage due to Near Death Experiences (NDE) because of one last attachment or desire.
‘EGO' is fighting with soul one last time. This is the final showdown. The soul is just trying to show the way to ‘ego'.
If you just listen to your soul. The soul will lead you like a guiding angel. Some call it spirit guide, I call it wisdom of the soul.
Your soul wants to be liberated and your ego wants to run its show who wins this is a matter of awareness and surrender.
Now it is time for ‘ego' to go.
Here master can be helpful.
If you remain aware and you surrender to the soul:-
At this stage, DEATH of the ego happens and there should be someone to bear labour pain and the master becomes WOMB to ‘new you’, then you transcend to the next stage LIFE. (this stage is also called heart chakra blockage).
————————STAGE LIFE ——————-
OLD ‘ego' is gone now new Life will have a new set of rules. This is the new dawn and the new world because at this stage your Third eye is already opened. You are renewed, resurrected.
Life is beautiful.
This is the stage of self-realization.
Now you have a choice:-

You can become Epicurus or Buddha if you remain aware, both are beautiful. This is where one leads authentic life. You enjoy every minute of your life. Neither Life nor death can shake you. This is what I call ‘immortal', you have become Immortal.
From here MASTER can't help you. You will be guided by your wisdom which can lead you to NEXT STAGE -BLISS.
——————-STAGE BLISS———————
This STAGE is called BLISS or Buddha-hood. If you come to this STAGE by denying material life then you have the possibility of becoming BUDDHA- full of pure love and awareness.

Why is India the land of scientific knowledge and spiritual wisdom?,"Spiritual wisdom comes with an inward journey and India has always respected people who won themselves.
We never gave significance to people who won the world like Alexander - The Great, we only respected people who won their inner world like Krishna, Ashtavakra, Buddha and Mahavir.
And at end of the day science is going to serve humans only if there is no spiritual wisdom then this world will end soon by nuclear war."
"Is the peace and stillness in the mind me? Eckhart Tolle says so. If so, can you prove it logically?","There is emptiness and silence, stillness and peace are attributes of emptiness.

Can we find inner peace in the outer world?,"Absolutely YES, but you have to understand that your being is bliss.
These stars, sky, earth, mummy, Papa, brothers, sisters are here because of your being.
Your being makes this world go round.
You are, that is why everything is, this world ends with you and it also starts with you.
People come and go who cares?
But if you don't appreciate your being then who will?
Be grateful to your Mom and Dad who made it possible for you to visit this wonderful planet.
Remove your past by forgiving everybody without prejudice.
There is a zen story;-
Disciple asks the master, “How can I remain happy in every situation?”
Master says, “ When you wake up in the morning - Just ask yourself :-
Do you want to be sad or happy today?”
And if you decide to be sad - then remain sad all day even if you get enlightened.
But if you decide to remain Happy then remain Happy even if this city is burnt in the fire.
Happiness is a climate that comes from your understanding of your being.
Your ‘being' is BLISS.

Why did I get scared when doing past life regression therapy? I suddenly saw purple light and got extremely scared and uncomfortable before going down the stairs.,"Past life regression is to work with the unconscious mind and collective unconscious mind. Collective unconscious mind is a different world altogether in other time and space where we store our memories of previous lives as a community.
Whenever awareness touches the unconscious mind then the repression of this life and other lives are resurfaced (individual experiences ) but when awareness touches collective unconscious mind then you enter the other world where you meet unknown or little known people and the sufferings of those you loved in previous lives including death and birth of loved one like father, mother and brothers, sisters.
That triggers the near death experiences (NDE) that is why people feel scared.

What are the healing powers of tantra?,"Tantra is nothing but an excuse to justify lust. Tantra healing centres are more like massage centres.
They say something and do something else.
Tantra healing centres are centres of hypocrisy.
People talk about the divinity of tantra just to cover their filthy mind.
What is spiritual about tantra when there is the duality of male and female?
Tantra is the path of primitives and it is full of lust and via lust, no one can reach absolute truth.
Your energy is limited and energy has to be saved so that it can travel upward.
This world is lust and celibacy is divine. Spirituality is not the pursuit of attainment. Achieving mind can only collect garbage in the name of tantra. Spirituality is divine if you transform energy if you still think of sex and think you can reach ultimate truth, you are absolutely wrong.
The quality of energy is transformed by saving it not by consuming it.

Path of tantra is barbarian and it belongs to the lowest domain of human instinct.
PS: Tantra makes sense after spiritual awakening not before that.

Is being emotionally detached and spiritually awakened the same thing?,"Emotional detachment leads to spiritual awakening not the vice-versa.
There is two types of attachments:-
1. Attachments to possessions.
2. Attachments to relationships.
People live their life with false sense of ego of possessions – I have biggest house, I have an Audi, Merc and false sense of ego of relations - My wife is most beautiful lady, my kid is most intelligent guy in school.
All these identifications keep feeding your false ego all your life.
All our life we keep moving from things to person, then person to person then again person to things and this circular shifting of the preference keep you busy all your life.
The day you understand this frailty you become witness and in deep communion with your true-self detachment happens.
Generally what we know as emotions are negative emotions like anger, hatred, jealousy and greed etc.
Why we remember these emotions because these emotions are the cause of losses we have in our life whether the loss is emotional or monetary.
Awakened person becomes empty of these emotions and what remains is not positive emotions but the understanding - an understanding which comes out of his being.
Positive and negative are two ends of the duality and awakened person lives beyond these two ends. And Beyond these ends of the worldly affairs, godliness breathes - awakened person lives out of that godliness.

"Often I feel I am fully awake, free, done, my seeking is truly over. Why might I still feel compelled to compare my ‘level’ to another ‘awake’ one? Like I must still be ‘missing something?” Can one ever admit ""Aah, I'm 'awakened, the game is over?","This question in itself is absurd and illogical.
But I couldn't help answering this question.
When there is no ego (mind's ‘I') then who will you compare to whom?
Now here is the point:- immediately after awakening you return to old habits but if you just remain witness sooner you will find the meaninglessness of comparing yourself with others.
Remember: The mind has not vanished it has taken a backseat and whenever you call it - it will come with a few old habits.
Solution?
Be compassionate about living not life.
Let this life have a bigger meaning.
Leave this world a little more beautiful.

Spiritual awakening is ‘death and resurrection'.

"Why do they say ""the eyes are the windows to the soul?"" Can someone explain it to me.","Look into the eyes of enlightened beings. The eyes of enlightened beings are directly connected to the soul.
The silence you feel in his presence and the stillness you see in his eyes is because of his direct connection with the soul.
And
Every soul is the heartbeat of the absolute that is why every soul is equally beautiful.
We come from the absolute one day we shall dissolve into absolute.
Eyes are not only doors to the soul it is the gate to absolute.

How many times should one listen to Channa Mereya after a breakup?,"5000 times.
Till you get the point in lines:-

Till you know you loved wholly - life is all about giving and forgiving.
Be thankful and appreciate that you have been loved.
Now the “Let go”.

What does it mean to “let go” spiritually?,"“Let-go” is an overused and misused word in the spirituality and better words and the appropriate term is “Take no Notice”.
If you love somebody or hate somebody you remain related to the same person. Spiritually there is no difference.
There are two paths to absolute truth one is self-cultivation and the other is enlightenment.
Very few have reached absolute truth by self-cultivation but the path of enlightenment makes more sense where you become unaffected by laying down all casual thoughts.
Just practice - ‘Take no Notice'.

How do all the enlightened people talk so flawlessly? Does this come with enlightenment?,"When one is enlightened he lives in absolute truth where all fictions of mind end.
Yes, clarity comes with the realisation that all complexities of the mind are just because of the nature of the mind.
Truth is absolute but the mind talks in terms of facts, facts are just rationalisations of the mind.
The mind thinks in loops or patterns and the mind is least concerned with truth, the mind needs something to short-circuit the thinking loop it is not concerned with true or false.
From absolute truth that short-circuits happen very easily. That is why you feel the rare insights in the words of an enlightened being.

"Do all thoughts with lobha (craving), dosa (aversion), and moha (ignorance) create bad karma?","There is no good or bad karma. All you know as good or bad karma are just the product of your mind's construct of cause and effect.
Just remember you are not a doer you are just a witness.
Your identification with your mind's ‘I' aka ego makes you think that you are doer.
When you say ‘I' you mean your ego.
But the day you know you are not your ego, you are not your emotions, you are not your possessions, you are not even your relations - you are just a WITNESS -
All your misconceptions about Karma will be deconstructed and you will start to live here and now.

Can you explain spirituality with science with an example?,"Science is objective, art is subjective, religion is being and spirituality is the transcendence of your being.
There is a big gap between science and spirituality.
The mind leads to science, the heart leads to art, your being leads to religion and your soul leads to spirituality.
If anybody can bridge science and spirituality then everybody will be enlightened and enlightened people can be produced on the Assembly-line. Spirituality belongs to a space beyond the mind, where all the questions of the mind cease or spirituality leads to the transcendence of mind.
Any explanation of spirituality by science is going to miss the real – any explanation or conceptualization will be absurd.

If I surrender to Osho will he save me in crisis?,"Neither Osho nor any other God can save you.
God is a myth, a hypothesis that never comes even to say “Hello”.
Considering there is a saviour which saves us is a reflection of your fear.
God and the devil is the duality of the mind. God is the positive devil and the devil is a negative God.
When we see our parents fallible then we look for something infallible - we start to believe invisible.
God is flawless, ultimate and unquestionable.
Why so?
We always strive for perfection and out of that urge we create image of God.
It is the same urge that creates superhuman movies like Spiderman, Ironman and Superman.

Does the ego ever be in unison with one’s true self or is it constantly going to be in fight mode?,"Man is continuously in the split. The split is because of conflict between ego and true-self.
When the ego dissolves then you become whole centred in your being.
Whole spirituality is to centre yourself into your witness aka true-self aka soul.
Even just before awakening the conflict continues.
What you know as ‘dark night of the soul' is actually the conflict between true-self and the ‘ego'.
Your ‘soul' wants to run a marathon and your ‘ego' is insisting like a child not to leave.
Ego wins.
If you are afraid to face dark night then you won't see the dawn.
Soul wins.
If you decide to take the plunge then your soul/ true-self will win.
Ego is mind and true-self is no-mind.
The conflict ends when you attain no-mind.

"Why does everyone always assume surrendering means you're going to get something good? What if surrender leads to poverty, obesity, and ruin?","No one can surrender…………….. if you surrender then you are living the myth of surrender because surrender happens.
Only in the myth of surrender one is bound to expect something good in return.
When surrender happens in the deepest realms of trust you live like the bird on the wing.

"Is it not a contradiction that the word awakening itself means becoming more alert, aware and conscious and yet it is said that one must forget oneself in meditation for hours together.. Is enlightenment about forgetting oneself or becoming alert?","Everything you asked in the question is because of the wrong understanding of meditation.
Meditation is non-doing and mind is doing - awakening is permanent disidentification from the mind.
Mind is past, mind is future but the mind is not present.
Mind is time:-
Awakening is disidentification from the concept of time.
You are as old as this earth and the concept of time is more or less equally old.
The concept of time is deeper than the concept of God. It is in your DNA, blood and bone marrow.
The last thing that drops before awakening is the concept of time and the moment concept of time is dropped you return to the present permanently.
If I have to summarize Awakening in four words that would be:-
LIVE HERE AND NOW.

Why is marriage considered an important part of life? What can be the alternative to marriage?,"Marriage is bondage, marriage is unnatural.
Marriage is dream, divorce is truth.
Divorce is more important than marriage.
The marriage and divorce take you on to the journey of the soul.
From body to soul.
Most of the husbands are henpecked and most of the wives are Hitlers.
50% of the neurosis are because of marriage.
I know people who take twin flame as escape from marriage. People keep looking for thousand and one ways to keep themselves distracted from married life.
50% of emails and messages I receive are related to pornography addiction and sex.
Actually, cosmetic industry, fashion and movie industry are the proofs that men are voyeurs and woman are exhibitionists. Men enjoy to see and women enjoy to show.That is why marriage is unnatural.
No intelligent man should get married or every intelligent man should divorce immediately.
This life has greater meaning, why to confine ourselves to one person.
With every person you meet , you become a better person.
Everyone should get married and marriage is important ONLY as a lesson.

"While witnessing the mind's content (Vrittis) objectively, I noticed, they eventually get reduced to mere sensations and gaps. But, something that is aware of these sensations & gaps remains. Is that thing my mind? How should I proceed further now?","To understand ‘something that is aware of gaps' you have to understand the difference between witnessing and witness.
In witnessing still there is subject - mind's ‘I' or duality or there is subtle traces of ego.
But the witness is beyond subject and object and that is none other than AWARENESS.
AWARENESS is is-ness (movie screen) where everything happens but nothing changes like the sky - clouds come and go but the sky remains as it is.
How should I proceed further now?
This part of the question is my concern because this part also shows your longing to progress and that is where we all tend to fail.
Why?
When you tend to strive for progress then you reinforce duality and this pushes you away from AWARENESS.
What is the solution? How will it work?
The gaps you experience are the gaps where the meditation happens or in a way you touch the AWARENESS. If you just ‘be' and don't try to do anything then these gaps will become larger and larger and one fine day one of the gaps will become permanent - you will enter NO-MIND.
NO-MIND- The permanent cessation of mind as master.

Can you spiritually awaken without going through 'The Dark Night Of The Soul'?,"Absolutely yes, but with two conditions - you should be as forgiving as Jesus and as compassionate as Buddha.
What you know as ‘dark night of the soul' is actually the dark night of the ‘ego'.
Your ‘soul' wants to run a marathon and your ‘ego' is insisting not to leave like a kid.
Who wins?
Of course, if you are afraid to face dark night then you won't see the dawn.
Ego will win.

Can meditation help me control my thoughts and feelings?,"Thoughts can control feelings or rather can suppress feelings but nothing can help you to control thoughts.
How can a snake bite himself?
How can mind control mind?
Mind is chaos, noise and commotion. The very nature of the mind is restlessness. That is why the mind is synonymous with a monkey.
Yes, of course, you can transcend the mind altogether.
Meditate by witnessing your thoughts and when you meditate there will be gaps between your thoughts and if you keep meditating for years then one fine day one of the gaps will become permanent and you will enter no-mind - the permanent cessation of mind as master.
Then the mind becomes utilitarian and you use it on demand.
Silence can only be attained permanently otherwise one day you will be silent and another day you will be noise.

If we are not the voice in our head but we are the one who is aware of the little voice in our head then does that awareness have a voice besides the voice in our head? I guess the question is does Our Consciousness have a voice of its own?,"Absolutely yes, our awareness does have a voice of its own which is different from the voice in your head.
That voice is felt as the voice of the soul. If there is no inner voice then enlightenment is a myth.
But the fact is everybody in this world knows the inner voice.
Criminals have to drink one bottle of alcohol then they commit crime. Why because they too have an inner voice.
When we say find your inner Guru - what is that? That is the inner voice of the soul/awareness.
Enlightenment is the journey of the soul and who decides the right and wrong - your inner voice - the voice of the soul.
There are two voices - the voice of your head (conscious mind) and the voice of your soul (awareness).

"Who is better, Acharya Prashant or Osho?","Acharya Prashant is better than Osho. Osho has a very notorious image. As I can make out you are a girl.
Path of Osho is full of dirty things as the energy hits the sex centre a thousand times in a day while your brain is deprogrammed and if you become unconscious you might may become characterless, commit crime or suicide because of the subtle changes in your brain which cause madness.
I have met people who take breakfast with ancestors everyday and some can fly to the roof. Some can see their soul walking in front of them. Some see thousands of black dogs. I have gone for a long drive with these people and their inhibitions (they know as ghosts). Path of Osho has nothing but pain and it is scary too.

One who is ready to die can consider following the path of Osho.
Enlightenment is a fancy word but the truth me it is the most difficult path because:-
Enlightenment is death and resurrection.
Disclaimer: At absolute truth there is nothing like ghosts it is all person's inhibitions.

"According to Carl Jung, is collective unconscious good or bad? Should we try to achieve it or avoid it? And how is it different from the self?","Carl Jung stopped at collective consciousness because he was not mystic but there is one more step/stage - Cosmic Unconsciousness also.
Let's understand how it works:-

The conscious mind is active and we use the conscious and subconscious mind in day to day activities, below it we have an unconscious mind where our conscious mind stores memories, knowledge as memory blocks and retrieves it on demand of the conscious/subconscious mind.
Still one level down we have a collective unconscious mind which is part of our society/political ideology and religion.
One more level down we have a cosmic unconscious mind which includes all of the earth- animals, rocks, mountains. It is a universal mind or cosmic mind - an order of disorder before this creation or re-creation.
Once one attains samadhi, he dives down to the cosmic unconscious mind.
One who attains samadhi goes deeper and simultaneously the keys to higher and higher open till cosmic consciousness.
It happens like this your awareness goes deeper to roots - cosmic unconsciousness and your consciousness starts climbing the ladder upwards to the cosmic consciousness (super consciousness).
Or
You can say as awareness goes deeper inward the consciousness becomes super-consciousness."
"Do awaken people ever suffer from losing a loved one? Suppose an awaken man/woman lose their child, is there no grief for them?","Yes, they grieve but out of compassion. People grieve because they regret not saying “sorry” for all the pain they caused the person when he was alive.
Generally what we know as emotions are negative emotions like anger, hatred, jealousy and greed etc.
Why we remember these emotions because these emotions are the cause of losses we have in our life whether the loss is emotional or monetary.
Enlightened being becomes empty of these emotions and what remains is not positive emotions but the understanding - an understanding which comes out of his being.
Positive and negative are two ends of the duality and enlightened being live beyond these two ends.
And
Beyond these ends of the worldly affairs, godliness breathes - enlightened being lives out of that godliness.

What are some baby steps I can take to drop my ego?,"You can't drop ego PERIOD.
How can you drop something you are? You are your ego, dropping ego is a myth. Without ego, you will become an empty beer can.
Ego can not be dropped, ego can only be observed.
How to observe ego?
Excellent Trillion Dollars Question! (Sorry to borrow your answer opener - Shiv Bhushan Ji).
The key to observe your ego is “disidentification” from everything.
What is identification?
Billion Dollars Question! (Now this is mine).
There is the degree of identification with the mind's “I” and its activities it can be observed without awakening/enlightenment.
Watching a movie is a good example of being completely identified and ironing your shirt or hanging your clothes out to dry aren’t the activities that you become so taken up with that you forget everything else. These are different levels of identification.
We can think of identification as ‘about attention'. When you are present, attention is divided between yourself ( subject) and the object of your observation, with identification attention, is drawn by the object of attention. The intensity of identification can be determined by your fascination for the object of attention.
e.g. If someone is smashing your friend's car windscreen and if someone is smashing the windscreen of your car. The difference will be of identification. You will get identified with your car but not your friend's car.
In the case of a friend's car, you will have distance and you stand as a witness (Sakshi).
But the fact is you can remain disidentified in case of your car also. That is what is meant by being a witness.
The identification limits our understanding of ourselves and of the world.
Be a witness, don't analyse.
‘Witnessing’ is the key to observe your ‘ego'.

"Is it true that if you raise your spiritual energies enough, then even planetary influences stop to influence?","There is no spiritual and non-spiritual energies. Energy is energy and planetary influences stop when your mind viberates at lower frequencies.
Holes in your soul:-
What is Soul ?
Our true-self is our soul. Every soul is full of compassion, surrender and trust. We are beyond our body and mind. Sometimes body or mind gives us glimpse into what we are beyond body and mind. There are no words to describe it. It is our being (is-ness) that unifies us with existence and liberates our souls from the cycle of birth and death.
The obsession of material belongings and attachments creates holes in our soul. There are two things which keep us bound to material world:-
Possessions (achievements feed our ego)
Relations (specially toxic)
Desires create the bounding to material world and extinguish our kundalini and we exhaust energy and remain miserable.
As you know man's persona has seven chakras, seven centers and from all sides the center that is activated pulls in what is amenable to it. The center becomes receptive. If the center for anger is activated, it will draw in waves of anger from all around it. If the center for love is activated, from all directions it will attract toward itself waves of love.If the center for passion is energized, from all sides waves of lust and passion will race toward it. A man becomes like a deep abyss and from everywhere all that he craves flows into it.
Desires or obsessions are the main cause of our sufferings and this is what keep us in this Maya.
What to do to fill holes in our soul?
Stop identifying with possessions and achievements. Stop trying to possess others.
What Buddha said 2500 years ago is more valid today because now we are deeply conditioned to competition and relationships. We have become more unconscious of our true-self. We have started to enjoy our slavery to our desires.
There is thin line between desires and needs.
Needs are basic and desires are unlimited.
Relations have become more of business than understanding the emotions of others.
What if you live just for today. What if you enjoy being with people. What if you find peace in doing small things.
Life will be more of joy than sobbing moron.

Will failing to achieve material goals lead to failure in spiritual life as well?,"Goals, failure and success are the words of the achieving mind. These words have nothing to do with spiritual life.
Spirituality is more of a state of vairāgya ( detachment, aversion ) where the reason for vairāgya doesn’t matter and vairāgya has nothing to do with ‘doing', it happens.
It can happen because of the death of a loved one, break up of relations (loss of someone), failing to achieve material goals and boredom from over-achievement too.
Spirituality happens beyond all the concepts of achieving mind as spirituality means non-achieving and just being now and here.

Is it true that spirituality is a madness that helps us deal with Samsaric sadness?,"samsara/sʌmˈsɑːrə/
noun
the cycle of death and rebirth to which life in the material world is bound.

Sadness is part of Samsara because nothing seems to give happiness permanently.
Desires and attachments are the wheels of Samsara.
You desire something all your life but the moment you achieve that, it loses its charm.
This is the very nature of Samsara that is why there is nothing that can keep you happy forever and the cycle of birth and death continues.
Spirituality is the mean and enlightenment is the end.
As Buddha said - Life is suffering, there is the reason for it - the reason is desires and attachments - Sufferings can be ended by desirelessness,non-attachment and by attaining ‘Nirvana'.
Nirvana means ‘Blowing out the flame of desires and attachments.’ Empty all that we know as happiness. Let life flow without friction. The desires and attachments are the holes in your soul.
The cycle of birth and death can only be broken and soul can only be liberated by attaining Nirvana.
What you know as Sadness is the madness of Samsara.

Why do Buddhists want enlightenment?,"Buddhists never use the word ‘enlightenment'. Buddhists know the word - Nirvana.
Nirvana means ‘Blowing out the flame of desires and attachments.’ Becoming is not the concept of Buddha. Emptying all that we know as happiness in this world is basis of Buddhism.Path of Buddha is path of negativa.
Enlightenment is the word used by modern spiritual masters. There is nothing to be enlightened about.
Buddhists believe the cycle of birth and death can only be broken by attaining Nirvana. That is what Buddha taught for more than 4 decades.

What is this life? If death comes and takes it, what is this life?
‘Life is a goal'.
Happiness is Advaita - non-dual. Your mind is misery. Life is only happiness. Happiness is climate.

What is the most common misconception about spirituality?,"There are many but the main three are:-
People think spirituality is the search for God. They feel spiritual (kind of) by going to temples, churches and donating money to trusts and NGOs. People try to find a place to go like the Himalayas and Monastery in the name of spirituality which is actually an escape just like having alcohol to relax.
People recite Gita, Koran and Bible but it has nothing to do with spirituality.
People follow dogma, creed and become conditioned to cults and rest of their life they never taste the truth.
Spirituality is not a head-trip it is a dialogue heart to heart dialogue with the absolute truth.
Spirituality is to be in communion with existence - with the river, tree, stars and the sky."
"Does 'karma' mean that everything that happens to us is under our control, or only that we are responsible for it?","‘Karma' means doing - there is no good or bad karma.
Just the motive behind the karma can be good or bad but not the karma itself. Karma is the wheel of creation.
If the Karma can be good or bad then Akarma is bound to be good or bad and what about Vikarma?
Buddha said, “Whatsoever you do unconsciously is a sin.”
So the greatest sin in this world is to live unconsciously.
The thousand and one sins are committed in the state of unconsciousness.
Don't make mistake of thinking that one can be unconscious by consuming alcohol or drugs. One becomes unconscious in anger, lust and greed also.
The greatest virtue is to remain conscious and the greatest sin is to live unconscious.

Is spiritual enlightenment a fundamentally egoic pursuit/realization because the entire experience or liberation (including positive benefits of inner peace) only happen to a particular body/mind and not every other consciousness throughout creation?,"Enlightenment is the search for an authentic life - a life that is beyond and which is within. A life where life itself is a goal.
Enlightenment doesn't happen to an individual it happens to the existence because its ripples are felt millions of miles away.
An enlightened person carries a climate that sends out the sense of possibilities every man carries.
Krishna, Buddha and Jesus are someone who still light the path of the millions.
Enlightenment happens to the whole of humanity.

"In order to awaken more, should I connect with my true self or my higher self? Are both the same or different?","First the second part of the question:-
Are both the same or different?
Yes, both are the same and both are called soul.
To awaken more, should I connect with my true self or my higher self?
Awaken more or less is the language of mind where you think you are the ‘doer' like you are the centre of the universe.
To connect to your soul you just need to cease to be a doer as an ‘ego'.
Wu Hsin calls it - Wei-Wu-Wei - doing without doing or doing through non-doing.
When one ceases to resist What-Is and becomes more in harmony with It, one attains a state of Ming, or clear seeing.
And then all action becomes wei wu wei, or action without action (non-forcing) and then there is a working in harmony with What-Is to accomplish what is required.
 As the clear seeing deepens the Golden Gate understanding then great understanding arises that there is no one doing anything and that there is only the One doing everything through the many.
From this flow the seemingly separate me is a misapprehension, created by the mind which divides everything into pseudo-me (subject) and object (the world outside of this me). This seeming two-ness - duality (Dvait in Sanskrit), this feeling of being separate is the root cause of unhappiness and dissonance.
Once you know you are and things happen (or life happens) you will know your true-self.

At which chakra does the union of IDA and Pingalanadi take place?,"The first non-dual chakra ( spiritual chakra) is Vishuddha Chakra (Throat Chakra) which is where the union of Ida and Pingala takes place (first four - Root, sacral, solar and heart chakras are dual in nature).
At Ajna chakra, all three Nadi - Ida, Pingala and Sushumna meet that is the point of union much like Triveni Sangam (tri-confluence) of Ganga, Yamuna and Saraswati."
What are the differences in heart hurt and ego hurt?,"There are three ways one can get hurt :-
Ego hurt
Heart hurt
Soul hurt
When someone denies your proposal and you feel offended - That is ego hurt.
When someone denies your proposal with a reason and you feel heavy heart - That is heart hurt.
When someone denies you altogether without reason - That is when your soul hurts.
But all the reasons have ‘ego’ in it in one or the other form. Truth is no one can hurt you if you don’t try to change things. Let the life come as it is, let your being be the most important thing in this world for you. Let the happiness come from within."
"When people talk about the ego, what does the ego refer to?","‘Ego' in spirituality means mind's ‘I'. It is a mental construct of the conscious mind.
When you say, “I love ice cream.” - your mind's ‘I' loves ice cream.
The misunderstanding comes when we refer to the ‘ego' in ordinary language - in ordinary language ‘ego' means “the inflated individual's conception of himself.”
‘Ego' is not a stable phenomenon - when you talk to your servant - you feel like an owner. When you talk to your Boss you feel like a servant.
‘Ego' takes the easiest route to feel important by exclusion or substitution.
The ego works like Shifting Sands.

How can I fight with bad thoughts despite meditation?,"There is no bad or good thoughts you give them the flavours by identifying with them.
Moreover, you make them more powerful by avoiding them. This reminds me of a beautiful Tibetan parable:-
An old saint knew how to fly and he became very famous. A young man got interested in knowing the secret. He swore that he would devote his whole life to know the secret to flying. He started to live with the old saint.
………
After few months, tired of the young man, because twenty-four hours a day he was there…Finally the old man got fed up. He told the young fellow, “Today I am going to tell you the secret. It is not very difficult. It is very simple.”
He said, “Everything is hidden in the mantra —Om mani padme hum.”
The young man said, “ Don't fool me. This is the mantra everbody knows.”
The old saint said, “ I am going to give you the secret key to open this mantra nobody knows.”
The young man said, “Key? I have never heard that there is a key to open the mantra.”
“The key is, while you are repeating the mantra – just for three minutes – don’t let any monkey pop into your head.”
The young man said, “You seem to be an old idiot! In my whole life I have never thought of a monkey. Why should I think of one?”
He rushed down the stairs of the temple where the old saint lived. But strangely, even though he was not chanting the mantra, monkeys started coming. He would close his eyes and they would be there. He would run to this side and they would be there. They were not outside, they were inside his head. As far as he could see, only monkeys and monkeys.
Somehow he tried to sleep but all night monkeys kept crowding his head and the house.
By the morning he was so tired that he rushed to old saint and said, “Please take away your key. I am almost mad!”
The old man said, “That’s why I was not telling anybody, because the key is very difficult. Now do you understand why I was silent? Now it is almost impossible to take back the key.”
He said, “I don’t want to listen to a single word from you. You just take this key back and let me go home. And I don’t want these monkeys to follow me!”
The man dropped the mantra, he dropped the key. He closed his eyes and there was no monkey. He looked all around and there was no monkey. He tried just once on the way, to see what happens when he says Om mani padme hum and closes his eyes. And they were all coming, from all directions.
All your thoughts are monkeys. Never force any thought to go away; otherwise it will rebound with greater energy. And the energy is yours! You are on a self-defeating track. The more you throw it away the more it will come back.

Is being authentic addicting?,"There are two ways you can live your life.
One you can live your life by the mind - if you live your life by mind then you will lead a super-successful life.
But achieving-mind can't be authentic; it has to learn artificial ways of the world. You can be clever, cunning and successful and then your mind knows a million ways to be unhappy.
Or
Two you can live your life by heart. You can be loving, sharing, understanding and forgiving and then your heart knows a million ways to be happy.
Your mind leads to an authentically phoney life and your heart leads to original life - a life which doesn't know how to be authentic because you know no other way to be, but being original.

"In spiritual practice, some people watch 'movements of their breath' and some others watch 'movement of their thoughts'. Now, as there is only a difference in 'objects', are both these practices are same?","Watching 'movements of breath' or 'movement of thoughts' are same from meditation point of view.

‘Flow’ is movement not ‘object’ and flow of anything remain flow therefore both these practices are same.
When you watch breathing then you should follow the breathing and with every inhale you breathe life and with every exhale you breathe death. There is a gap after every exhale and inhale in that gap meditation happens. In other words, meditation happens at end of exhale and inhale.
Watching thoughts If you are watching thoughts , no matter where your thoughts will take you, there will be gaps between any two thoughts and as you keep meditating these gaps will become larger and larger and one fine day one of the gaps will become permanent - you will enter state no-mind.
The permanent cessation of the mind as master.
Meditation is to reach Stillness in Flow.

How do I forget a bad memory?,"Absolutely ‘Yes' and that is what spiritual awakening is all about.
All the memories good or bad you have are part of your mind which you consider as ‘self'.
That ‘self' is the mind's ‘I' or some call it ‘ego'.
That mind's ‘I' is not your true-self.
That is why it works like shifting sands.
Your true-self is beyond perceptions, logic and concepts. True-self is unwavering and doesn't give damn to all that you know as bad memories.
Transcendence of mind is attaining of permanent bliss.

Time and space are not two separate things rather they are two aspects of one thing. Time is nothing but the fourth dimension of space. If time disappears, space also disappears.
If man goes beyond his mind, he goes beyond time and space. He dissolves into eternity by remaining in present. He is, but he is beyond all identifications of mind including memories and future.
He exists without any definition of where and when, just in now. This is what we know as an awakening - now mind doesn't confine you.
Once you are disidentified from your mind then memories won't remain more than a movie you watched in the ’90s.

Why is Lord Shiva called Rudra?,"
Brahma, Vishnu and Rudra are the psychic knots in our brain and also called Granthi.

People have lost the true meaning of Brahma, Vishnu and Rudra. These are not God as we know in Photos and idols. They are symbolic existence of psychic knots in our bodies which can be untied to experience the divine- The laws of the highest cosmic plane where all manifestations are governed. These are granthis (psychic knots) in our subtle body which are governed by laws of the cosmic plane we know as God.
There are seven chakras in our subtle body and three granthis (psychic knots) — Brahma, Vishnu and Rudra.
Brahma knot is a combination of Muladhara Chakra and Svadhisthana chakra which is the base of our existence connected to mother earth. Earth is our mother our creator. Muladhara is male and Svadhisthana is female.
When Muladhara Chakra meets Svadhisthana Chakra then energy is released for higher ascension.
Vishnu knot is a combination of Manipura Chakra and Anahata (Anahata means unhurt) chakra which represents the heart. Our heart beats that is why we survive. It is a preserver. Manipura is male and Anahata is female.
When Manipura Chakra meets Anahata Chakra then Vishnu Granthi (knot) opens and energy is released to the next higher ascension.
Rudra Granthi (psychic knot) is a combination of Vishuddhi Chakra and the Third eye (Ajna Chakra) if it is opened then Sahasrara chakra is bound to open. Vishuddhi is male and Ajna Chakra is female.
When Vishuddhi Chakra meets Ajna Chakra then the third eye is opened and all the illusionary world of Maya is destroyed.

Now the third eye (Ajna Chakra) will only open if the concept of God is destroyed because the concept of God is the subtlest hook of Maya. There is a problem because nothing can destroy Lord Shiva as the presence of Shiva is very powerful so one more form is required out of necessity - Rudra (the destructive form of Shiva) comes in and destroys everything including the subtlest hook of Maya himself -Shiva.
(Path of Tantra is full of devotion and paradoxes.)
The ego dies if the third eye is opened and one attains the non-dual self who knows nothing of Maya-World you knew before.
That is why Rudra is called a destroyer, destroyer of your mind's ‘I' or ‘ego’.
7th Chakra is Sahasrara Chakra if it is opened then one attains Moksha. That is why all Hindus break open the skull on a funeral. This is just a shortcut.
People are not aware that by breaking the skull one is not liberated or one doesn't attain moksha. One has to open all three psychic knots and then on the opening of Sahasrara chakra one attains Moksha. When Mahavira got enlightened, he was called Nirgranthi - free of all three psychic Knots.
Brahma, Vishnu and Rudra (Mahesh) do exist in the world of Maya and they are as real as any entity but by going beyond the mind these appearances are just symbols. We need these symbols because our mind works on symbols and signs.

Do spirituality and science go hand in hand?,"Science is objective, art is subjective, religion is being and spirituality is the transcendence of your being.
There is a big gap between science and spirituality.
The mind leads to science, the heart leads to art, your being leads to religion and your soul leads to spirituality.
If anybody can bridge science and spirituality then everybody will be enlightened and enlightened people can be produced on the Assembly-line.
Spirituality belongs to a space beyond the mind, where all the questions of the mind cease or spirituality leads to the transcendence of mind.
Any conceptualization is going to miss the real – any conceptualization will be absurd.

Is it possible for an entire city to give off negative energy/vibes?,"Yes, that is what pandemic is causing when there is the silence of death because of lockdown.
Wuhan, China was the first in the row to spread negative energy. The whole city became the city of the dead bodies.
In case of a pandemic, the answer is ‘yes' otherwise it is unlikely."
How can I meditate for an hour a day for 60 like Naval Ravikant recommends?,"Don't make goal of meditation. If you make a goal of meditating one hour then your ego will make it an ambition and you will struggle meditating , you will be frustrated.
Meditation is non-doing. Doing is a way of moving out. Non-doing is a way of moving in to the centre of your being.
The trick to meditate is to become observer of mind.Meditation starts by being separate from the mind, by being a witness of mind. e.g. When you look at mirror , you will only see your face if there is a distance between your face and mirror, if mirror is too close to your face you won't be able to see your face. Likewise when you become observer/witness of mind then a gap is created between mind and witness/observer/watcher.
Watching is the key of meditation. Watch your mind. Don’t do anything – no repetition of mantra, no repetition of the name of god- As you watch, slowly mind becomes empty of thoughts; but you are not falling asleep, you are becoming more alert, more aware.
As the mind becomes completely empty.Just by watching, you immediately get out of the mind.
While witnessing there will be gaps between any two thoughts and as you keep meditating these gaps will become larger and larger and one day the gap will become permanent - this is called no-mind.
Permanent cessation of mind."

What is the difference between self realization and enlightenment?,"It is said that seven days after his enlightenment the Buddha was passing by a man on the road who was struck by the radiance of his face and his peaceful presence.
The man stopped and asked , “ my friend, who are you? Are you some angel or God?”
“No,” said the Buddha.
“Well, then , are you some kind of magician?”
Again Buddha answered , “No.”
“Are you a celestial being ? “
“No.”
“Well , then what are you ?”
The Buddha replied, “I am awake.”
Buddha means “one who is awake”- self-realised.
The difference between self-realisation and enlightenment :-
What you know as ‘I' is mind's ‘I'.
There is false-self as an ‘EGO'. There is duality.There is subject and object also.
When duality of mind's ‘I’ dissolves - it is called self-realisation.
When dew drop realises itself, it is self-realisation.
When existence merges into your being that is called enlightenment.
When Ocean merges into dew drop , it is called enlightenment.
In other words - when the sixth chakra(Ajna chakra) opens then you realise your nondual self and that is called self-realisation and when the 7th - Sahasrara Chakra + 8th-Bindu Chakra and 9th -Talu chakra open then it is called enlightenment.

Can blood pressure be cured by meditation?,"No, meditation can't help you cure high blood pressure directly.
High blood pressure is the result of competitive life where one is always trying to gain and stake.
Though meditation may consolidate the mind patterns but meditation in itself won't cure the problem of high blood pressure.
I know people meditating for 20 years and still not sure - what is meditation?
You will have to live a life of balance like walking on a tight rope.
Understand that you are not your desires, you are not your attachments - you are the sky and everything else is the cloud."
"The books by Eckhart Tolle were very popular because they had the answer that if you are totally in the present (now), you are totally happy. But are people now disappointed because he had no way to get there, since he got there by accident?","Getting there is certainly not easy it takes time but the methods are really easy:-
All you need a ‘heart full of love’ and meditation.
or rather I would say one who is capable of loving can be meditative otherwise people look at meditation as an alternative medicine for all kind of neurosis.
People come to me and ask me how can I get more of silence. Now how can I tell them silence is silence there is no quantity of it.
When you love your ego dissolves into love, it melts into love.
Just remember love simplifies your mind and only a simplified mind can remain in present.
It is my own experience people who are loving and caring tend to live life like a child.
Surprisingly what you are finding hard to be in, once it was your natural state.
Look into the child’s eyes, look and you will see tremendous silence and innocence. Every child comes with a natural state of meditativeness, but he has to be taught the ways of the society and religion – he has to be taught how to think, how to calculate, how to use logic, how to argue; he has to be taught language, concepts and words. And gradually he loses contact with his own innocence. He becomes polluted and contaminated by society. He becomes an efficient mechanism; he is no more a human.
Once he learns new tricks of mind he is no more the same who used to be innocent.
But there is good news…… that you just have to regain what you have lost during your growing years. The possibility is inside of you.
All that is needed is to regain that silent space once more. You have known it before, so when for the first time you taste meditation, a great feeling will arise in you as if you have known it before. And that feeling is true: you have known it before as your natural state. You have forgotten. But if you can uncover it, you will find that again – it is always yours.
We are born as meditators and our natural state remains hidden somewhere deep down. Any day, a little digging, and you will find your natural state still flowing.
And the greatest joy in life is to find it again.
How to find it?
Just meditate by witnessing.
While witnessing there will be gaps between any two thoughts and as you keep meditating these gaps will become larger and larger and one fine day one of the gaps will become permanent - you will enter no-mind. The permanent cessation of the mind as master.
You will reach the silent space - where there is no noise of past and future, you will live here and now.

Which spiritual places are best to visit for spiritual?,"There is no spiritual place though there are many religious places.
You can visit thousand and one religious places but you will not be able to have a single glimpse of spirituality.
Spirituality is an inward journey whereas religion is outward pursuit.
You may taste silence at religious place but that won't remain with you for long.
To be rooted in silence permanently - There is nowhere to go, but in.

"Why should I be patient if I want to learn silence, progress in meditation, and have peace of mind?","‘Patient': bearing pains or trials calmly or without complaint.
‘Patient' is a negative word and ‘Progress' is a positive word - meditation is beyond negative and positive.
Silence means the absence of negative and positive noise.
Meditation is non-doing. Doing is a way of moving out. Non-doing is a way of moving into the centre of your being.
The trick to meditate is to become an observer of the mind. Meditation starts by being separate from the mind, by being a witness of the mind. e.g. When you look at the mirror you will only see your face if there is a distance between your face and the mirror, if the mirror is too close to your face you won't be able to see your face.

How does one get affected spiritually after tearing money into pieces?,"Suddenly you are struck with a sense of your wholeness.
You realise the value of being whole, people try to become perfect but the exact meaning of life is in wholeness.
Wholeness is always in present and perfection is always in future.
Torn pieces of money are like a person who is split into ‘to be' or ‘not to be'.
We miss life when we don't live with wholeness."
"What is the medical issue I have with so much noise in my head? I am f*cked off with people telling me the same bullsh*t, I know I'm meditating right, but really, is it a Chakra blockage?","It is not chakra blockage this happens when the conscious mind is dropped then the conscious mind makes a lot of fuss in thousands and one way and one of the way is to keep repeating some music tune or making weird sounds/noise.
This is a tussle between your awareness and conscious mind as your consciousness is splitting into conscious mind + awareness.
If you are chanting - leave it for a while.
Meditate by witnessing your thoughts.
Normally this happens just before the opening of the sixth chakra."
How can someone who is burdened by worldly possession adopt spirituality?,"Going to the Himalayas….. Going to Monastery…..Leaving the family…..
are not part of spirituality - spirituality means a search for an authentic life - a life which knows no death.
What good will it be if you attain silence in the Himalayas? Himalayas are already silent.
I know people who go to secluded places and attain silence but when they come back to the market they return to the same old habits.
You should follow spirituality in the noise of the cities where you are tested every minute with awkward behaviours of the sleepy people.
There is no burden on you, burden comes when you are full of desires and attachments or rather you get identified with your desires and attachments.
Once you understand you are not your desires, you are not your attachments - you become spiritual.

Isn't some people's definition of enlightenment really just anxiety relief?,"‘Heart’ is meaningful word to you, nose, eyes and tongue are meaningful words to you but ‘soul’ is just a word for you and ‘God’ is just a word for you.
Likewise ‘enlightenment' is just a word for you.
Because you have no experience of God, no experience of the soul and enlightenment. To have a meaning or definition either we have to define it by something you know or mind will choose to deny it altogether.
Some say you are already enlightened - Aha... You can relax there is no need to seek.
Some say enlightenment is beyond human experience - Aha.. I want to remain human.
Some say enlightenment is work of millions of births - Ah.. I want to live this life at fullest.
Mind is very articulate to deny incomprehensible or also good at creating substitutes. Those who fad up choose substitutes and other may deny it altogether.
In both the cases the seeking ends and one becomes anxiety-free.
Both the cases will lead you to desirelessness.
But those who are fad up keep looking for substitutes, in this case they might not be able to drop the ‘last desire to be desireless'.
Denying ‘enlightenment' altogether is culmination of the desirelessness - that is what happened to Siddhartha.

“You have to move on. I am only a teacher, not a master. I was pretending and I am very sorry!” said Buddha’s master.
Buddha was totally shattered and tired.
He went to take a dip in a nearby river, Niranjana. It is a very small river; in the summer it is not even one foot deep. And he was taking a bath, but he was so weak that he could not cross that small current. He had to hang onto a branch of a tree for a few moments to gather some energy so that he could get out of the river. He felt like cheated in the name of enlightenment.
That experience made it clear to him there is no enlightenment.
Though denying to be real master can only be claimed by the real master, according to me Buddha’s master was real courageous master who declared himself charlatan.
Buddha’s last hook of attachment and of desire to be enlightened disappeared in one stroke.
His enlightenment came out of desirelessness and enlightenment can happen to anyone who’s seeking has ended.

Is it fine to notice surrounding sounds during meditation?,"Vipassana
Absolutely not, when you breathe with mindfulness then you should follow the breathing and with every inhale you breathe life and with every exhale you breathe death.
There is a gap after every exhale and inhale in that gap meditation happens, if your mind keeps wandering in outer sounds you will miss the precious moments of meditation.
In other words, meditation happens at end of exhale and inhale if you don't follow your breathing then it will not be Vipassana.
Witnessing your senses/feeling/thoughts
If you witness only sounds around you not the breathing then it is good meditation.
If you are witnessing thoughts then it is okay.
If you are witnessing emotions then it be perfectly okay."
Are there stages of enlightenment?,"Enlightenment is like peeling the layers of an onion and stages are there of the path of enlightenment.
Here is list :-
Stage 1 : Life of Chicken Shit :-Here people live as phoney personality Frederick S. Perls called it Chicken Shit. Here one leads a life of a poor actor. Everything he does is according to society but he doesn't mean anything. He says hello to somebody to avoid him, he sheds tears on a funeral but he means no sorrow.
2. Life of bullshit Bullshit:-
I am the president of the USA. I am the husband of Ms universe. Frederick S. Perl's called it Bullshit. They become police officers and politicians.
These identities are where most of the people spend their whole life.
3. Chaos:-
When something bad happens in life, people fall into Chaos. Death of loved one or divorce. People tend to become drugs addicts or alcoholic. Most of the artists fall in this layer.
Now, one has two options either one can fall back to stage one and live life normal or they transcend to next stage.
4) Psychological Death (Death of ego):- This is the DEATH layer, where one touches death experiences of oneself and loved one. If one remains aware in this layer by meditating then he or she enters the LIFE phase.
To be frank, in this layer you need a MASTER who can give birth to your new ego otherwise you will move like a zombie or you will revert to layer two or one. When this layer is being peeled this is Awakening of Heart Chakra. This is also called 'dark night of the soul'. This term was first mentioned in a poem written by the 16th-century Spanish mystic and poet St. John of the Cross. From here you are most likely to descend or transcend. Be careful and remain aware.
5) Resurrection (New life):-
Word has a deeper meaning than you might think. This is a new birth or born again.
Old is dead now new Point of view is there towards life. New ego( clean framework) is born. This is the stage when Kundalini hits third eye (6th Chakra). This is where one enters Samadhi for few days or weeks.
6) Grounding:- After a few (13 days Maximum) days or 2 weeks of Samadhi one returns to normal state meanwhile his state of mind has already changed to no-mind (superconsciousness). A new framework of mind needs time to ground. Here one is more open and compassionate about learning to live this life again. This stage has a duration of 9+ months.
7) BLISS:- In this stage one enters Turiya (Cosmic consciousness). Now one leads a life of compassion and awareness. He starts doing things he loved and finding peace in small things. This is where he becomes Buddha.

And inner transformation will give you dark night of the soul. The closer you get to your soul the more wounds will be healed one by one.
Inner transformation is the realisation of the soul.

"Why did Osho look so old according to his age despite doing meditation and meditation? It appears he was in meditation because when speaking, it actually rejuvenates the body.","Enlightenment brings a whole new set of health problems as the physiology of the body changes ,it reverses the energy system.
The energies that travel downwards and follow laws of gravitation of earth now energies are governed by the gravitation of the moon.
Many times Osho used to fall because of the energies used to accumulate in the upper body (upper chakras) very little energy used to remain in the lower body.
After enlightenment, the energies are transformed into feminine as aggression is neutralised.
Meditation becomes useless after enlightenment as an enlightened being is always in meditation.
BTW - Meditation is mean not the end.
Restlessness is the very nature of the mind. Mind can be anywhere but not in present.
Meditation is something beyond mind. Meditation can help you reduce your erratic thoughts. But still, thoughts will remain.
Meditation is one and crucial part of the inner work. Meditation alone can not ensure inner peace.
If meditation is making you a bit silent then meditation is not working on you.
Meditation should shake you, it should give you a dark night of the soul.
Inner peace can not be ascertained till your mind remains. It will be one day peaceful other day hell.
Inner alchemy happens when you attain no-mind.
I totally disagree with people who keep meditating for decades. They have not worked on inner transformation. They have missed the point.
The only purpose of meditation is to transcend meditation when your life becomes a meditation. You don't sit even for 5 minutes to attain inner peace. Inner peace prevails in every moment of life. Meditation happens in every moment of life.
Your walking is meditation, your eating is meditation and your sleeping is meditation. You become a meditation.

How do I fake enlightenment?,"Rather I choose to answer the question - “What is the shortest way to attain enlightenment?”
Why did I change the question?
Tricks are good at playing cards. You can fake enlightenment but in that, you will be cheating yourself. You just can not cheat the existence.
All so-called religious people are already faking that. Religious people are already cheating gullible people in the name of God.
What is the shortest way to enlightenment?
Watchfulness is the shortest way. It does not need thousands of lives to attain it. The length of time doesn't matter but the intensity of longing, the way you feel thirst; when you feel thirsty for truth – as if it is a question of life and death – you put your whole energy to this and the door is bound to open.

You know what watchfulness is. You watch a movie. You watch TV.
Just close your eyes and let your mind be a screen of a movie or a television, and whatever passes on the mind you simply remain watchful, doing nothing, not even judging - just witnessing:-
Let the thoughts come and go.
The screen will start becoming empty as your watchfulness becomes stable. Soon the watcher is there but there is nothing to be watched, the screen becomes completely blank.
And when the watcher is left alone, it starts watching itself – because that is its nature, to watch. And to watch oneself is the greatest happening in anyone’s life. Everything else happens through it – blissfulness, silence, ecstasy, and finally going beyond even all these experiences and just remaining in a pure is-ness.
The is-ness of things is awareness of self - Rupert Spira
Never think of faking enlightenment; it is worth attaining it.
Watchfulness is the shortest possible way to enlightenment.

"Shouldn't people who ask questions about the characteristics of Enlightenment, or the best path for attaining it, request that only those who have attained Enlightenment (aka arahants) offer answers?","Mystics say, “ There is no such thing as 100% lie, even the white lie has a pinch of truth.”
According to me what is more important that sometimes lie can lead to truth, sometimes even wrongs may become rights, and sometimes even false step may lead you to the truth. It may seem false, false devices can be helpful.
In fact, you will be surprised to know thousands years of the spiritual quest has given birth to interesting stories, parables and koans.
Spiritual teachers may be phoney because they repeat what they read from scriptures and other masters.
Spiritual masters may be charlatans and they have a distinct ego that they have attained.
But the problem is our mind which loves fictions. Now use a thorn to remove a thorn, then throw them both away.
Fiction has to be used to tackle fiction. All that you read and listen from spiritual masters is fiction much like Harry Potter and Alice in wonderland.
They don't speak the truth but you have no choice to accept it as truth because there is no other way to verify. That is why every spiritual master has his theory without any proof.
Now just pay attention to the following points:-
Is there a soul?
No standard answer all blah blah blah…
Buddha says “No” and Mahavira says “Yes”.
Is there God?
No standard answer all blah blah blah…
Buddha says “No” and Mahavira says “No” but Hindu say “Yes”.
Is there reincarnation?
Buddha says “Yes” but he says there is no “soul”, then what gets reincarnated.
Surprisingly there is no God, Soul and reincarnation.
The only truth in spirituality is ‘enlightenment’ rest all are devices and any answer the spiritual master gives will do.

Sadhguru says that joy and misery happens within us and we can create whatever emotion we want. Is it possible? How can we do it?,"I disagree with this statement as neither happiness nor misery can be created.
Try creating misery when you are happy and try creating happiness when you are unhappy.
In both the case it is all mind games.
What I agree on that you can be an observer/witness in both of cases.
Real alchemy happens when you remain witness to whatsoever is happening.
Humans live in two extremes of positive and negative, but divine resides in being witness aka Sakshi."
"After a spiritual awakening, is it common to feel depressed and unmotivated to do anything with your life?","Absolutely not,
The search for the spiritual awakening is the search for a real-life, authentic life, which knows no death.
Spiritual Awakening doesn't change a thing in life. Everything continues to happen the way it used to.
We enter on a rare pilgrimage after a spiritual awakening.
Answer the question:-
What is this life? If death comes and takes it, what is this life?
‘Life is a goal'.
Happiness is Advaita - non-dual. Your mind is misery. Life is only happiness. Happiness is climate.
Spread happiness by helping people heal their past and live with a purpose. You have found a new goal.
People need your help to be happy. Love them equally.
Let there be the light of joy, leave this world a little more beautiful.

Spiritual teachers may be phoney because they repeat what they read from scriptures and other masters.
Spiritual masters may be charlatans and they have a distinct ego that they have attained.
But the problem is our mind which loves fictions. Now use a thorn to remove a thorn, then throw them both away.
Fiction has to be used to tackle fiction. All that you read and listen from spiritual masters is fiction much like Harry Potter and Alice in wonderland.
They don't speak the truth but you have no choice to accept it as truth because there is no other way to verify. That is why every spiritual master has his theory without any proof.
Now just pay attention to the following points:-
Is there a soul?
No standard answer all blah blah blah…
Buddha says “No” and Mahavira says “Yes”.
Is there God?
No standard answer all blah blah blah…
Buddha says “No” and Mahavira says “No” but Hindu say “Yes”.
Is there reincarnation?
Buddha says “Yes” but he says there is no “soul”, then what gets reincarnated.
Surprisingly there is no God, Soul and reincarnation.
The only truth in spirituality is enlightenment rest all are devices and any answer the spiritual master gives will do.

"How do you operate in life after spiritual awakening, if you have no interest or joy in doing anything?","What you know as joy is the joy of things. What you know as interests are the pleasure of counting.
One more pair of shoes, a new boyfriend, new girlfriend are just another name of the old habit of the urge to have many and more.
Why don't you ask for one more sun and one more moon?
How many times did you enjoy the rising sun and full moon?
I leave that for you to ponder.
Because you know the joy of things, a spiritually awakened person knows the joy of being.

Do you consider OSHO an enlightened master?,"“Can you even drink beer?”, They asked.
I said, “Bring it!”
That was the first day I tasted beer. They could not believe their eyes.
They said, “You have completely gone down. You have become completely unspiritual. What are you doing?”
I said, “Enough is enough.” And in seven days I completely forgot the whole project, and I forgot it forever. The seventh day it happened – it happened just out of nowhere. Suddenly all was light; and I was not doing anything, I was just sitting under a tree resting, enjoying. And when I laughed, the gardener heard the laughter. He started to think that I was a little bit crazy, but he had never seen me laugh in that way. He came running. He said, “What is the matter?” I said, “Don’t be worried. You know I am crazy – now I have gone completely crazy! I am laughing at myself. Don’t feel offended. Just go to sleep.”

Enlightenment is not rare but the path of enlightenment is always rare.
No two enlightened beings reach enlightenment by the same path.
Osho was not only enlightened but also great master and in the words of Osho:-.

Immediately after my enlightenment, I rushed to the village to meet two people: first, Magga Baba, the man I was talking about before. You will certainly wonder why.... Because I wanted somebody to say to me, ""You are enlightened."" I knew it, but I wanted to hear it from the outside too. Magga Baba was the only man I could ask at that time. I had heard that he had recently returned to the village.
I rushed to him. The village was two miles from the station. You cannot believe how I rushed to see him. I reached the neem tree....
I rushed to the neem tree where Magga Baba sat, and the moment he saw me do you know what he did? I could not believe it myself--he touched my feet and wept. I felt very embarrassed because a crowd had gathered and they all thought Magga Baba had now really gone mad. Up till then, he had been a little mad, but now he was totally gone, gone forever...gate, gate--gone, and gone forever. But Magga Baba laughed, and for the first time, in front of the people, he said to me, ""My boy, you have done it! But I knew that one day you would do it.""
I touched his feet. For the first time, he tried to prevent me from doing it, saying, ""No, no, don't touch my feet anymore.""
But I still touched them, even though he insisted. I didn't care and said, ""Shut up! You look after your business and let me do mine. If I am enlightened as you say, please don't prevent an enlightened man from touching your feet.""
He started laughing again and said, ""You rascal! You are enlightened, but still a rascal.""...
I then rushed to my home--that is, my Nani's home, not my father's--because she was the woman I wanted to tell what had happened. But strange are the ways of existence: she was standing at the door, looking at me, a little amazed. She said, ""What has happened to you? You are no longer the same."" She was not enlightened, but intelligent enough to see the difference in me.
I said, ""Yes, I am no longer the same, and I have come to share the experience that has happened to me.""
She said, ""Please, as far as I am concerned, always remain my Raja, my little child.""
So I didn't say anything to her. One day passed, then in the middle of the night, she woke me up. With tears in her eyes, she said, ""Forgive me. You are no longer the same. You may pretend but I can see through your pretense. There is no need to pretend. You can tell me what has happened to you. The child I used to know is dead, but someone far better and luminous has taken his place. I cannot call you my own anymore, but that does not matter. Now you will be able to be called by millions as theirs, and everybody will be able to feel you as his or hers. I withdraw my claim--but teach me also the way...
After my enlightenment, for exactly one thousand, three hundred and fifteen days* I tried to remain silent--as much as it was possible in those conditions. For a few things I had to speak, but my speaking was telegraphic.
The man who forced me to speak--for one thousand, three hundred and fifteen days I had remained silent--was very strange. He himself had remained silent his whole life. Nobody heard about him; nobody knew about him. And he was the most precious man I have come across in this or any of my lives in the past. His name was Magga Baba
He forced me to speak. He said, ""Look, I have remained silent my whole life, but they do not hear, they do not listen. They cannot understand it; it is beyond them. I have failed. I have not been able to convey what I have been carrying within me, and now there is not much time left for me. You are so young, you have a long life before you: please don't stop speaking. Start!""
Many people become enlightened, but not all of them become masters--for the simple reason that they are not articulate, they cannot convey what they feel, they cannot communicate what they have experienced. Now it was just accidental with me, and I think it must have been accidental with those few people who became masters, because there is no training course for it. And I can say it with certainty only about myself.

How does meditation help in the generation of alpha and theta waves?,"There are three states of meditation and each state is deeper than the previous one. These are the states (Alpha, Theta and Delta) that are the subject of scientific research nowadays.
Beta and Gamma state of mind is normal (waking) thinking mind with lot of conscious or unconscious thoughts.
How does meditation help in the generation of alpha and theta waves?
Alpha State:- This state is characterized by a brain frequency of 8–13 cps ( cycle per second) - to enter this state you need to make determined efforts (Sankalpa). This is a meditative state with contents much like a dream. You have to remain aware purposely. This is where most people give up.
Theta State (4–7 cps):- This is similar to Alpha State but deeper and characterized by sudden intuitive insights. These insights are global and come from the collective consciousness like theologies. This state is where one doesn't have to make efforts it happens like sudden shifts and these shifts are a state of no-mind where something of art happens like Beethoven and Mozart.
Delta State (3cps and lower):- This is the deep sleep state in which there is no consciousness - there is only awareness of involuntary functions of the body like breathing and heartbeats. This is also known as Samadhi where the conscious mind (ego) dies and the meditator enters something similar to death. This state is very rare and when it happens it can continue for 13–21 days. This is also known as enlightenment. Ego (conscious mind) drops forever and one enters a state of no-mind permanently.
Turiya (<1 cps):- There is a fourth state which is beyond all these states and the basis of mysticism. Where neither one can enter voluntarily nor involuntarily. Where ‘I' merges into existence - it becomes part of the tiniest grain of sand and the newest leaf of the tree.
Where the outer universe becomes a reflection of the inner universe. This is the point of no return.
If Delta State is death then Turiya is divine rebirth.

"Facing issues in lucid dreams and in the spirit world, spirits try to hold me. How do I protect myself during sleep?","Put two pillows both sides of yourself and keep a blue light on while sleeping.
This is second plane of reality where you have to protect yourself in ghost world and in this plane of reality nothing seems to work from our real world.
You need to have unwavering trust in Shiva (he can control demons/spirits) and always accept his decisions.
If you pray he will come to protect you.
All you are going through is fear of uncertainty and it happens around every new moon.

"There is a member who controls me from childhood, the problem is if I agree with him all is good but if I deagree it hurts his ego, I feel like I'm being controlled wherever I go. I don't know what to do?","Disagree but never be disrespectful. If you are right then he can't do anything. He doesn't have any power over you only power he has is given by you.
In fact, one who controls others is not even a man. He is powerless. His only entertainment is you.
Don't miss any chance to see him powerless when people disobey him. Let him notice you noticing his originality.
Another person is not more than you think he is.
Never ever ever put anybody on a pedestal."
How much can eating meat affect your chances of getting enlightened?,"Meat-eating doesn't affect anything directly but it certainly makes the energies heavy.
If a cannibal becomes enlightened then all other cannibals will try to eat him to taste enlightenment.
This is paradox because once you become enlightened then you can eat meat then there is no problem. But very idea of killing becomes absurd for enlightened being.
Working with people on the path of enlightenment I have found that meat-eating causes blockage at the heart chakra and because of that I have seen people struggling for decades and live a miserable lives.
I have heard stories of butchers who became enlightened but personally, I have not found a single meat-eater person progressing on the path of spirituality.
The very idea of killing something is a blockage on the path of spirituality and what to talk about eating it!
There is one more twist when you progress on the path of the divine you automatically tend to hate meat.
So if you eat meat then the time will come you will automatically start avoiding or finally turning vegetarian forever.

Can the third eye allow one to travel/visit/see other dimensions?,"The third eye opens new dimensions in itself.
Our mind is full of fictions and most of what we see is filtered through our belief system. This belief system is based on our dual nature which is always biased.
Opening of third eye destroys your illusionary world based on duality of mind.
Now you see the world the way it is without any mirage of mind.
How would I know that my third eye has opened?
When your third eye is opened then this world looks clearer and more colourful (super HD) and nuke 3D because the third eye gives more depth and non-duality to the vision. The third eye also helps you see miles away as compared to ordinary eyes.
Why does the third eye give almost infallible intuition?
With the opening of the third eye, the sensory system works directly with the subconscious mind and the duality of mind drops so as the fiction part of the mind as words and language of the conscious mind is bypassed and every thought and vision is crystal clear.
Opening of the third eye almost gives you latent powers like no-mind and silence of this very existence.

What is Soul? How it is created,"‘Heart’ is meaningful word to you, nose, eyes and tongue are meaningful words to you but ‘soul’ is just a word for you and ‘God’ is just a word for you.
Because you have no experience of God, no experience of the soul. To have a meaning or definition I shall have to define it by something you know, otherwise it will be useless for you.
You know yourself as mind (ego/karmic body), you know yourself as your name. But you are beyond your mind and name and that is what we know as true-self.
Your true-self is unwavering and silent and that is center of your being.
If I have to define it through positive then it is center of your being which is everybody’s eternal truth.
If I have to define it through negative then I will say, “The miseries that you have are not part of the soul.”
Second part of the question is very tough :-
What is a Soul? How is one created?
Cosmic consciousness has its own laws and rules through which this existence is run like we all have a set of rules and laws as an ego to work in this world.
Only awareness doesn't have any laws or rule because awareness is the fabric of our existence and everything is built on top of it , awareness which is everywhere and any living being is a matter/tangible version of that- awareness.
Hence, pure consciousness aka awareness is building block of our soul.
The universe is an expansion of energy, and life is the crystallization of that energy. What you see as the ocean, waves and stars all are manifestation of the same energy in infinite forms.

Is Shanmugam's attempt to bridge science and spiritual enlightenment a pseudoscience?,"Does the content in the link make any sense to you?
I doubt it because all the content in the link is work of classic human mind. If anybody can bridge the science and spirituality then everybody will be enlightened.
This attempt shows that he is still groping in the darkness of mind and this is failed attempt.
The spirituality belongs to no-mind, where all the questions of mind cease and there remains the understanding of being rather than becoming.
You can’t make dogma out of teachings of thousands of years.
Any conceptualization is going to miss the real – any conceptualization is absurd."
"If self-realization can happen here and now, then why do so many people go to the Himalayas to seek realization?","Self-realization always happens here and now but people keep missing the point and wander in Himalayas and monasteries.
Mystics have always said, ‘There is no refuge but existence’— there is nowhere to go but in.
One who seeks true-self will have to disappear, because no enlightenment, no liberation is possible without disappearance. Basically, everything you know as ‘I’ is bondage- a noise of the mind. Then how is enlightenment possible until this ‘I’ is dissolved?
Emptiness is our true nature. There is a silent space that is beyond the mind and it is known as no-mind. When you negate everything in your mind you reach emptiness. Emptiness is not negative it is full of beyondness, limitlessness.
Our home is where all the journeys end, where all enlightened beings reach and meet -Silence -emptiness-nothingness.

"Does meditation has any connection with sleeping? I've recently started doing mindfulness meditation and I've also started sleeping alot, I'm taking various naps throughout the day can anyone explain what is happening to me?","You have found the uncharted territory of a silent zone, you never knew before.
Most of the people who start meditation complain about this because they ignore the fact that now they have become calmer and now they don't need sleeping pills to sleep.
The point is to remain alert while meditating because the steps involved in sleeping and meditating are the same with one difference i.e. remain alert when the mind tries to sleep.
Here are steps and difference in sleep and meditation.
Let your body become loose.
Let your breathing become slow and deep.
Let your mind go blank.
Only difference is in the last step four.
In sleep you become unconscious and in meditation, you remain alert.
As this is the first stage of the meditation you will have to make efforts but in other deeper meditation, everything will happen automatically.

Does becoming enlightened lead to becoming emotionless?,"Generally what we know as emotions are negative emotions like anger, hatred, jealousy and greed etc.
Why we remember these emotions because these emotions are the cause of losses we have in our life whether the loss is emotional or monetary.
Enlightened being becomes empty of these emotions and what remains is not positive emotions but the understanding - an understanding which comes out of his being.
Positive and negative are two ends of the duality and enlightened being lives beyond these two ends.
And
Beyond these ends of the worldly affairs, godliness breathes - enlightened being lives out of that godliness.

"Does a person go into meditation involuntarily all of a sudden, then goes into deep bliss? He has to perforce make a determined effort, a Sankalpa, not to get into meditation unknowingly.","This question can only be asked by someone with very deep insight.
Because there is no answer to it (till my answer) and that makes this question unique.
There are three states of meditation and each state is deeper than the previous one. These are the states (Alpha, Theta and Delta) that are the subject of scientific research nowadays. Scientists are trying to replicate the same states of mind by scientific devices.

What is the fastest way of achieving enlightenment?,"The quickest way to achieve enlightenment requires you to understand the combination of all the path available.
Bhakti: the path of devotion.
Gnana: the path of intelligence.
Dhyan: Path of meditation.
Kriya: the path of energy - kundalini and chakras.
Now if you follow one of them then either you will not reach or you will have to shift between these paths.
But the quickest way to enlightenment is - when these all four come together then enlightenment happens. If you miss one of them you will miss the train.
Here comes the big-daddy of enlightenment- BUDDHA:-
FORGET everything just meditate and by negating everything (opting desirelessness and non-attachment) become desireless to the point that desire to be desireless also drops then one fine day with the falling of the morning star you might also attain enlightenment.

Feelings and cosy togetherness with grandma - just close your eyes and feel her presence, she will be right there.

"How can consciousness be ""all there is"" with nothing existing apart from it? Why is it then when people die, the physical world continues to exist without them? Why does my consciousness feel to be in my body rather than the body/world to be in it?","This is a tough one to answer.
Let me try:-
How can consciousness be ""all there is"" with nothing existing apart from it?
The container of consciousness is the mind (ego) where ego is the mind's ‘I'.
Until and unless your ego is a container of consciousness it will be felt in the body only.
Why is it then when people die, the physical world continues to exist without them?
When a body dies then consciousness is split into two.
Consciousness= conscious mind (karmic mind) + awareness.
It is believed awareness of the person dissolves into existence as awareness is the fabric of our universe.
The conscious mind (ego) is also energy (vibrations) and it is believed to enter an appropriate medium like a womb.
Why does my consciousness feel to be in my body rather than the body/world to be in it?
Only in enlightened being consciousness feels to be part of the whole, not only part of the body this experience of the enlightened beings raises this question otherwise there is no way to know this oneness.
When a person becomes enlightened then awareness and conscious mind both of them (consciousness) as a whole dissolves into existence."
Can we separate soul from body through meditation?,"Certainly, this question resulted in man's quest for the soul.
And enlightenment is the result of that quest which enables one to realise the soul or realisation of the soul is enlightenment.
People ask me many times that can we attain enlightenment without mediation? Maybe they find meditation very boring or difficult.
I tell them - only mediation can take you there, nothing else will work if you don't meditate.
Enlightenment is all about liberating our soul from this karmic body so that the cycle of birth and death can be broken.

What doesn’t time heal?,"There is the only thing that doesn't get healed with time is “ego”.
People keep living with the wounds of ego till they die although they know death will take away everything so what is the point in living life with grudges.
People close their heart and spend the rest of their lives in doubts not allowing love and compassion to penetrate their soul.
Little understanding can change the lives of millions - Forgive and forget.
Forgiveness sets you free of your past.

"Why is it that even with enlightened people, we don't agree 100% on every topic?","The last time I read The Bhagavad Gita, I was astonished to know the real meaning in it as I read it many times before enlightenment but every time I read Bhagavad Gita I took away a different meaning but all those meaning were useless as they didn't come from absolute.
It is easier to claim that you understand the meaning of the words of enlightened beings, but you disagree because you want to fit the words of an enlightened being in your context while words of enlightened beings are coming from a world that is beyond the words and language.
If you read Upanishads you will derive your own meaning which is not meant a single dime.
Likewise, you can't make sense of words of enlightened beings that is why they have to speak in koans and riddles.

"Why in today's society most people who feed their pathetic egos by not responding in time, very rude with people around and have mean selfish attitude are becoming winners in life?","This happens because they turn their inner voice off. Ego and selfishness are not two different things they are one and only needed trait to become insensitive to the inner world of people around.
The ego is always selfish and rude because it is always planning and manipulating, insecure and uncertain of the future. Certainly future belongs to an pious person.
People who live by heart don't think of the future much,they live in present thus they are sensitive and polite.
It is natural for a person to be loving and caring who live for today and not for heaven or hell of tomorrow.

How does a person experience total bliss from God and improve the quality of meditation?,"Krishna uses three words in Gita: karma, akarma and vikarma, meaning action, inaction and non-action.
Karma is doing - where doer as an ego and ‘doing’ exist. Akarma is inaction - an action without doer -where doer doesn't exist but doing is there.
Vikarma is where neither doer nor doing exists but everything is happening like your breathing, deep sleep and earth moving.
Meditation is Vikarma (non-doing).
To reach Vikarma (meditation) you need to witness - witnessing is inaction, whereas meditation is Vikarma.
When you witness your thoughts there will be gaps between thoughts and that is where the meditation or vikarma is and if you keep meditating by witnessing for years then one fine day one of the gaps will become permanent and you will enter a state of no-mind (meditation/vikarma) permanently.
Now you are rooted in no-mind/ meditation/Vikarma permanently.

Can a person’s twin flame be right in front of them yet they never notice?,"One can even miss noticing God in front of him what to talk of the twin flame.
People used to throw stones at Buddha and Mahavira.
When people can crucify Jesus then it is perfectly okay if you don't notice your twin flame for months or years.
But the good news is - it is certain eventually there will be synchronicity between both of you and someday you will notice the pull between the souls.
Twin flame appears like an angel, like a sudden clash of thunders when you expect them the least.
That is why it is the soul connection.

Can meditation vibes travel?,"First of all, we need to understand what is meditation waves?
Thought is not meditation wave.
Visualization is not meditation wave.
Affirmation is not meditation wave and finally, mantra chanting sound is not meditation wave.
What is meditation waves?
The silence that happens between thoughts, between mantra chanting, between visualisation and affirmation.
That silence happens between thoughts as a Gap and these gaps are unlimited and series of these gaps forms a message which can travel even across the oceans.
Now only skill you need is to meditate by witnessing you can send and receive any message to the person, to existence and to God.
Silence can reach silence whereas noise can reach neither noise nor silence.

Trees, birds and animals have no other way to be. They don't know how to be sad or happy. Even if you consider trees, birds and animals enlightened they are unconscious of it.
Like one can be unconsciously mad and one can be consciously mad.
Enlightenment is conscious madness.

What makes us stop being a good soul?,"Remember our soul is always pure and the cycle of birth and death is a journey of our soul.
There is no good or bad soul all our spiritual quest is to liberate our soul from the karmic body.
The day we realise our soul we attain Nirvana and we ultimately merge into existence, never to return because to be is to be in slavery.

"Is there a biological or medical science explanation for what happens in Kundalini awakening? This awakening can also occur due to emotional trauma, use of drugs etc . apart from spirituality . Is there is a biochemical process taking place?","The human body is much like animals, it is made for procreation and it functions much like any living being.
The only difference between humans and animals is of consciousness. Our consciousness is rational and logical consideration while the consciousness of animals is based on the instant stimulus. While humans consciousness gives one the ability to feel and think about others whereas animal consciousness is always restricted to selfish needs.
This ability to think and feel about others of human consciousness also gives freewill.Humans can turn consciousness inward.
When consciousness turns inward then the flow of prana starts to obey the gravitation of the moon rather downward gravitational pull of the earth to the sex centre.
This can also happen in an extreme state of relaxation under influence of drugs but it will be temporary.
The physiology of the human body changes and prana starts to surge upwards towards the moon.
It is yet to examine by medical science but it is the most mysterious phenomenon in the universe.
The upward movement of energy ( prana) carries all sort of mysticism of the human body and this universe (like Chakras, Granthis and kundalini).

If Divine consciousness has no ego why does it need/want 'life' to experience what it can not itself?,"Cosmic consciousness has its own laws and rules through which this existence is run like we all have a set of rules and laws as an ego to work in this world.
Only awareness doesn't have any laws or rule because awareness is the fabric of our existence and everything is built on top of it.
When you say divine consciousness, actually you are referring to pure consciousness aka awareness which is everywhere and any living being is a matter version of that- awareness.
The universe is an expansion of energy, and life is the crystallisation of that energy. What you see as matter is also energy, what you experience as thoughts, consciousness is also energy. What you see as the ocean, waves and stars all are manifestation of the same energy in infinite forms.

We have many examples of people like Elon Musk who are multi-talented. Why did J. Krishnamurti say to focus on one thing you are good at rather than doing different things?,"Elon Musk or any other multi-talented person is doing exactly what J. Krishnamurti says.
They are focusing on doing multiple things. Hunger for more and many drives one to be always in search for next best thing and that is how they become good at many things.
But they can't be best at everything.
What J. Krishnamurti says makes more sense and you can check this out with any multi-talented person like Elon Musk.
Getting best at something means learning more and more about lesser and lesser. This is how YOU become THE BEST."
I heard that if we didn't deal with our chakras concerning our health that it could turn into sickness. Could all our chakra keep us from getting the covid-19?,"Balancing of chakras does provide immunity to the body and Chakras are psychic centres, psychic doesn't mean they don't exist, Chakras exist in the subtle body and have corresponding points in the physical body.
Chakras don't keep us from getting the Covid-19 but they do help us recover from Covid-19 immediately, recovery can be as fast as 4–5 days and there will be no to very few side effects.
All the antibodies against Covid -19 are created from the second chakra (Hara Sacral chakra) immediately after covid-19 enters the body and emotional and psychological stability is provided by the root chakra.
To fight covid-19 we need Antibodies and psychological support, YES balancing of chakras provides immunity against Covid-19.

What is your understanding of a completely blissful life? Do you think we humans can live a blissfully life in the current scenario?,"Only awakened life can be blissful otherwise everything else is a less or more sleepy state of mind.
Blissful life remains untouched by what happens around you. Whatsoever you know as life is the noise of the mind.
One more pair of shoes and one more necklace, it is more like an every week new flavour. You keep yourself busy by desiring more and many, it feels like a never-ending streak, yet there is nothing to gain.
The ultimate blissfulness happens in utter desirelessness.

Why do spiritual seekers go away from family and surroundings?,"The spiritual journey is a journey of an individual where one has to forgo desires, possessions and attachments.
Desires, possessions and attachments are subtle hooks of worldly life. Once you start your quest to find your truth then one has to die for his past and so that one doesn't carry the baggage of happy or sad memories and attachments.
Your truth should bear out of the present, not the past. This is the meaning of SANNYAS.
It might sound absurd but one has to be renamed also and he should surrender his future to the master.
The whole process of self-realization is exactly the opposite of what we know as life.
The day one becomes desireless - by refuting attachments to possessions and relations, one becomes empty - in utter emptiness one becomes limitless, boundless.

Would living alone in the wilderness offer a fast track to enlightenment?,"Certainly yes, because all enlightened being became enlightened in the nature only.
There is one layer on us of social and religious conditioning, then next layer is of nature. In last comes our true-self.
Buddha, Mahavira, Ramana Maharishi and Osho all got enlightened in nature only.
We connect to our true-self well in beauty of nature but going in the wilderness purposely is futile because enlightenment can't be desired, desiring is worldly affair, you can desire anything in this world but not enlightenment.
Whatsoever you desire will become worldly and enlightenment is state of desirelessness.
The day your last desire to be desireless falls apart you become enlightened.

What is a soulmate? What is a twin flame? How are they similar? What makes them different?,"What is a soulmate?
Soulmates are people who’s souls have completed the journey up to the fifth chakra or above in the previous lives or in current life.
So both should be at throat chakra or above.
What is a twin flame?
The journey of the soul is the same in both the cases but the twin flame ascend from root chakra to heart chakra in the same life. There may be ascension in previous lives but the journey of twin flame starts from root chakra and ascension is simultaneous up to the heart chakra.
Both the cases are rare but as a journey of the soul continues in all our lives that is why soulmates and twin flame are possible for just about everybody.

"Whenever I meditate, I feel like something is caressing my face or holding my hands, and sometimes I feel like I am not alone. The first one doesn't really scare me, but the second makes me uncomfortable. What causes these feelings?","You are never alone there is a shadow of death walking by your side when you meditate you become conscious of death.
You need to accept death as your friend because all fears dissolve with an understanding of death as all fears stem out of fear of death.
Just surrender to God and have trust in his decisions. Only God can dissolve fear of death.
Next time around when you meditate let the feeling come and take a notice of it and let it subside."
Can I unblock someone else’s chakras for them?,"It is common practice in Tantra to open/unblock chakra of the opposite sex. The key is female can unblock the chakra of male and vice-versa.
A twin flame is an excellent example of unblocking the chakra of another person.
The only condition that conducive to such an event is a state of true love because true love induces the state of meditation.
People who love from the heart are natural meditators and meditation is required to unblock the chakras.
So there are two conditions 1) it requires opposites to work 2) there should be a true feeling of compassion between them.
"
What is the dark night of a soul? Can you explain it to me so that I have a better understanding about it?,"DNTS (DARK NIGHT OF THE SOUL) - the term was first mentioned in a poem written by the 16th-century Spanish mystic and poet St. John of the Cross.
This is actually a tussle between soul and ego, the soul wants to run for liberation and the ego is acting like a kid on a candy store.
This is the DEATH of the ego, where you touch death experiences of yourself and your loved one. If one remains aware by meditating then this leads to the opening of the heart chakra.
With the opening of the heart chakra, ONE leads a more balanced, loving and compassionate life.

"If Buddhist enlightenment is about detaching from suffering, you don't need to have any of the Vedic 'enlightenment' experiences at all, do you? To be an enlightened Buddhist, you just have to learn to detach. So, there are different enlightenments?","There are as many paths as many enlightened people, some formalised into religions another path remained secrets as those who followed those path remained Arhats rather than Bodhisattvas.
Detachment and desirelessness is the path of negativa where one empties the mind by negating everything you know as life or hooks of life. But negation is not negative because by negating one becomes limitless, boundless and silent.
But remember all roads lead to Rome.
There are many paths but there is one enlightenment there is no difference between the enlightenment of Krishna, Jesus and Buddha only difference is the path they followed to reach silence.
Detachment and desirelessness are the devices to reach your true-self.
Why does the path of Buddha work in modern days?
You can reach your true-self either by becoming everything or you can reach your true-self by becoming nothing.
Now if you become everything then there is no limit to what you can become because with advent of information technology there is an information explosion. This path is very long and arduous.
If you negate everything you know as life then there is a bottom limit to it and that is emptiness - reaching fullness by emptying is way more feasible than reaching fullness by becoming full.
In the words of Buddha :-
Life is suffering and there is the reason for it and the reason is desires and attachments. Once you stop identifying with desires and attachments you will reach silence.

"As it is said that enlightened people go beyond the idea of good and bad, can an enlightened person write a fiction book, especially a hard-hitting one, portraying the clash between good and evil?","All enlightened masters are good fiction writers and they have to create work of fiction because our mind loves fictions. Now use a thorn to remove a thorn, then throw them both away.
Fiction has to be used to tackle fiction. All that you read and listen from spiritual masters is fiction much like Harry Potter and Alice in wonderland.
They don't speak the truth but you have no choice to accept it as truth because there is no other way to verify. That is why every spiritual master has his theory without any proofs.
Now just pay attention to the following points:-
Is there a soul?
No standard answer all blah blah blah…
Buddha says “No” and Mahavira says “Yes”.
Is there God?
No standard answer all blah blah blah…
Buddha says “No” and Mahavira says “No” but Hindu say “Yes”.
Is there reincarnation?
Buddha says “Yes” but he says there is no “soul”, then what gets reincarnated.
Surprisingly there is no God, Soul and reincarnation.
I understand their difficulty but I can't compromise the truth.
The only truth in spirituality is ‘enlightenment’ rest all are devices and any answer the spiritual master gives will do. There is no way to verify their statements.
And that is the reason they seem - “KNOW IT ALL”.
PS: When I say there is God, you take it and when I say there is no God, you take it then there is no difference in both the cases you have accepted readymade answer. I say there is no God, soul and reincarnation, don't take my words, start your seeking, find your truth, my truth can't be your truth.

Shaktipat: How true is Shakthipat and Kundalini? Is there any genuine guru can initiate me to realize Kundalini?,"Shaktipat is as true as Kundalini. All living beings have kundalini because kundalini is the life force - the energy.
The energy which makes this world go round. Which makes this earth move.
Shaktipat is performed on initiation of disciple but it is misunderstood by people that initiation can happen just by finding the right Guru.
It takes years before disciple is initiated by Shaktipat. Shaktipat requires total surrender, which happens after years of association with the right master.
Shaktipat can't be delivered also it happens on its own. Shaktipat requires egoless medium (Enlightened Master/ Guru) hence if somebody says he can deliver Shaktipat, be wary of him.
An egoless medium can't claim to deliver Shaktipat. Shatipat happens in the great communion between Divine-Master-Disciple.

"I fear that after recognizing my true nature, I will lose interest in participating in society and having plans. Will I give up everything like a sadhu?","Don't worry you will never find your true-self with any kind of fear inside of you.
You will remain in your comfort zone.
This is all conspiracy of mind. The mind plays tricks on you whenever there is a chance for you to be awakened.
Remember: Awakening is all about death and resurrection, meek can't dare to come close to it.
Awakening is for a rebel, a rebel who can gamble his life for the liberation of the soul.
If you get a day to live as an awakened one by giving up the rest of your life, it is worth considering and attempting."
"I’ve decided to practice meditation on a daily basis. I’ve started meditating just two days ago and I try to meditate for at least 5 minutes since then, but mind is always full of thoughts and I can’t meditate even for 5minutes. How can I change?","The urge to change thing is a hurdle to the path of meditation.
Meditation is a mean to reach silence.
So meditation can't have a goal. You can get whatever you want by choosing and chasing but not meditation.
Meditation is non-doing. Meditation is witnessing.
Don't try to change a thing just let it happen on its own.
Doesn't matter how long you meditate, the key is to be consistent."
Is meditation a state of consciousness?,"Let's understand the difference between consciousness and awareness.
Consciousness = conscious mind + awareness.
Consciousness has subject and object. That means there will be a conscious mind that is in action.
Awareness doesn't have either subject or object. Awareness is free of two but active as an observer at peak.
Meditation is the bridge between consciousness and awareness.
What exactly is meditation?
Meditation is not concentration. Meditation is not contemplation.
Surprisingly, there is only one meditation like there is one sleep but we have many dreams. All thousand and one meditation(s) are just dreams or methods.
Marcus Aurelius wrote book meditations. There is no equivalent word to Dhyan ,only word that comes close to Dhyan is meditation (there is no such thing as meditations) in English.
Witnessing is meditation.
The ultimate alchemy that happens on enlightenment has seeds in meditation. We have three states of mind - waking, dreaming and sleeping. Fourth is not state it is our nature called Turiya. Turiya has something of waking and something of sleeping. Sleeping not in the way we know, sleeping means state of no-mind. What we know as witnessing in meditation is seed of Turiya. Once you attain the state of no-mind permanently- pure consciousness, all your questions become answers.
Witnessing or observing is a bridge to attain awareness as our permanent nature.
Witnessing is the only meditation and you can witness your breathing, your thoughts or your emotions. When you witness your thoughts, there will be gaps between the thoughts and when you keep meditating for years these gaps become larger and larger and one fine day one of the gaps will become permanent and you will enter state of no-mind. Where the mind doesn't remain master where mind becomes utilitarian.

What is the difference between a third eye and a crown chakra?,"The third eye is the sixth chakra also known as Ajna chakra or Agya chakra whereas Crown Chakra is the 7th Chakra known as Sahasrara Chakra.
The third eye is the chakra where the duality of the mind dissolves and the illusionary Maya world is dissolved into one whole world of unity - where the mind transcends the distinction between good and bad, happiness and sadness, loneliness and companionship etc etc.
Sahasrara Chakra represents the Nirvana or Moksha which is beyond human consciousness hence it is known as the Chakra of divination. Here mind not only transcends the distinction of duality, here mind itself is dissolved and new nature of being is born - Turiya.
Tutriya - The God's State.

Are the kundalini awakening and heart chakra activation you feel on twin flame path the same thing?,"Yes Heart chakra awakening in kundalini awakening and twin flame is same but twin flame path ends at heart chakra and there are higher centres of consciousness upto nine chakra and that is where the real liberation exists.
Twin flame is again dependency on other person and other person is always unpredictable. Heart chakra is last stoppage of duality and above heart chakra non-duality resides where you become free of happiness and sadness, loneliness and companionship etc..etc...
If you want to be happy forever don’t fall for twin flame, it will come on its own. Shoot for the higher centres of your being - enlightenment.

Who declares that someone is enlightened? Is there a panel of people that says he or she is enlightened? Who has declared the people who we see as enlightened?,"Our minds are busy thinking about others and not thinking about themselves. This question stems out of your doubting mind. Mind denies incomprehensible or creates substitutes and enlightenment is most incomprehensible happening in the history of mankind.
If somebody comes and tells you that such and such a person has attained enlightenment you will say, “no, he has not.” Even though enlightenment of other person will neither help you become enlightened nor it will bring hindrance to your enlightenment.
What does this question says - It says that you want to make sure nobody has become enlightened and that gives you sort of relief. If I have not attained enlightenment, there is no harm because nobody else has attained enlightenment either. This gives consolation to you that nobody has attained enlightenment so maybe there is nothing as such enlightenment. Somehow you want to find all kind of loopholes to show that the person has not yet attained or it is all frivolous.
But if you come to know that somebody has attained enlightenment , it cuts like a knife. Then comes the sadness, worthlessness and you assure yourself , “no!no!nooo! he has not.”
This is conspiracy of your mind. It is necessary for you to be aware of this mind games.
A true seeker should know all thinking about others is useless and nothing except him and his spiritual growth should concern him because everything else is meaningless.

Why do people believe others are enlightened just because they say they are?,"Enlightenment is the most elusive subject in the history of mankind. People have a fascination with the word ‘enlightenment'.
I guess it has something to do with the human psychology of crafting Gods and superheroes.
Everybody is ready to put someone on a pedestal and start worshipping him. If people can worship stones then it is very easy to worship someone looking larger than life.
And
So-called enlightened people are good at playing god regardless of they are enlightened or not.
This reminds me of the famous quote by Adyashanti:-

Or enlightenment means you become complete by subtracting everything you know as reasons of your life.
Seriously, if people start to understand the meaning of enlightenment then there won't be any charlatan."
Is permanent peace of mind a myth?,"Absolutely not, permanent peace of mind is rare but it is not a myth.
Mind is noise, chaos and commotion. Mind means restlessness, but there is something opposite of mind that is called no-mind - where utter silence persists, a place where pin-drop silence prevails regardless of what situation you are in.
But you have to earn it.
How to attain no-mind?
Meditation is the key to attain no-mind.
What is meditation?
The only thing beyond mind we know is Meditation.
Witnessing is the meditation.
How does it work?
Having said that witnessing is meditation. Now you can witness your breathing, your thoughts or your emotions. When you witness your thoughts, there will be gaps between the thoughts and when you keep meditating for years these gaps become larger and larger and one fine day one of the gaps will become permanent and you will enter state of no-mind. Where the mind doesn't remain master, where the mind becomes utilitarian.
This is where you attain permanent silence."
Is enlightenment something ordinary or is it something mystical?,"Yes, enlightenment is mystical because there is no step by step instructions to attain enlightenment.
What worked for Buddha couldn't have worked for Mahavira.
Every enlightened being reaches by his own unique path, though they all reach the same space.
When you negate everything(no matter how) in your mind you reach emptiness. Emptiness is not negative it is full of beyondness, being limitless.
Enlightenment is mystical that is why words and language can't contain it, can't express it, because words and language are always a noise of the mind.
Empty of all the words and language there is a silent space - where all the journeys end.
One reaches there where all enlightened beings reach - Silence.

'Witnessing' has been described as the method of meditation by many including Osho. Is it not boring to keep witnessing one's own awareness?,"Surprisingly, there is only one meditation like there is one sleep but we have many dreams. All thousand and one meditation(s) are just dreams or methods.

"Approximately, how many people globally have opened their 3rd eye (Ajna chakra)?","Less than 1% of the human population experience opening of Sahasrara chakra. Third eye opening is also not common. Even if somwhow it opens you won't be able to sustain that state of superconsciousness for long.
Beauty is not in opening of the Third eye and Sahasrara Chakra. The beauty of life is in retaining that state of superconsciousness. If it happens then one can experience clairvoyant, out of body experiences and crystal clear thinking.
Easy come, easy go experiences are more of a problem than boon.
I know 12 people who had third eye opening experience, but they are not able to repeat it and now they just long to experience the same for years or decades."
What do most people get wrong about enlightenment?,"Everything that the mind thinks enlightenment to be is wrong about enlightenment. Because the mind either denies incomprehensible or creates substitutes.
If you deny enlightenment you are wrong or if you create a substitute that is also wrong.
Neither of both thinkings is valid because enlightenment happens beyond the mind.
Enlightenment is not a state it is our nature - a nature hidden beneath our mind. Whatsoever you think life to be is phoney. The true-life is beyond the duality of mind - where neither sorrow nor happiness remains, where neither God nor devil remains, where neither truth nor lie remains, where neither death nor birth remains - it is TABULA RASA.
In the absence of everything, there remains a life full of compassion - the world of Buddhahood.

"If there is no God and no afterlife and your consciousness ceases to exist, what is the point of life?","If you accept the statement and ask what is the point of life is as good as you accept the God and afterlife.
These are borrowed truth and if you base your life on borrowed truth how does it matter whether God exists or not.
If there is no God and no afterlife and your consciousness ceases to exist, what is the point of life?
Existence of God is not your concern but afterlife seems to be your concern. God itself represents immortality and that is what bothering you.
What is life?
Life is a mystery to live, life is a quest to know your truth.

"Is it true that when you are enlightened, you no longer have anything to live for?","Enlightenment doesn't change a thing in life. Everything continue to happen the way it used to be.
We enter on a rare pilgrimage after enlightenment. I happened to read ‘The Ten Bulls of Zen' by Kakuan which is something unique in the history of human consciousness. Truth has been expressed in many ways, and it has always been found that it remains unexpressed whatsoever you do. The ‘Ten Bulls of Zen' by Kakuan have tried in a single effort to express the inexpressible.

The first eight bulls came from Taoism and two were added by Zen master Kakuan.
These two bulls represent the journey after enlightenment. The eighth bull represents enlightenment.
9th bull says ‘ life is a goal'.
You understand religion is mean not end. Religion is to make you happy not repressed. Happiness is Advaita - non-dual. Your mind is misery. Life is only happiness. Happiness is climate.
Spread happiness by helping people to come out of mind. You have found new goal.
Tenth Bull:- (returning to society) I go to the market place again with my bottle of wine and return home with my staff (disciples). Why one should follow the footprints of patriarchs?
People need your help to be happy. Now everybody is enlightened for you. Love them equally.
Answer the question:-
What is this life? If death comes and takes it, what is this life? What meaning does it carry if one is so impotent against death?
Remember, after birth everybody is on his deathbed. There is no other way. All beds are deathbeds because after birth only one thing is certain, and that is death.
The search for the enlightenment is the search for a real-life, authentic life, which knows no death.
Let there be light of joy, leave this world little more beautiful.

"If a Buddha has a non-discriminating awareness of things that is beyond duality, does that mean He/She is free from designating things as male/female or beautiful/ugly, how can it be possible for Him/Her to effectively function in our world?","Loss of ego is the disappearance of duality - discrimination - male/ female, beautiful/ugly and sorrow/happiness etc. etc…..
Loss of ego doesn't mean loss of aesthetic. The ego is the cause of all sorrows because the ego is afraid to die. It can find thousand and one reasons to be afraid of death.
But the absence of ego doesn't mean you are dead, the absence of ego means the absence of fear of death.
The absence of fear of death makes you more alive and compassionate.
Enlightenment is the start of the journey where neither sorrow nor happiness remains, where neither God nor devil remains, where neither truth nor lie remains, where neither death nor birth remains - it is TABULA RASA.
In the absence of everything, there remains a life full of compassion - the world of Buddhahood.

Is having plastic surgery and getting a tattoo a sin?,"No, but certainly it is disrespectful to you as an individual.

Who gets the tattoo done - a person who is confused and searching for his or her identity. The tattoo looks great initially but after sometime these tattoos look exactly like old clothes or fashion. Now Tattoo can not be removed so they try to modify it to other designs but the tattoo becomes a headache.
Any tattoo is dust on your consciousness. Any tattoo is a false meaning of your being.
Instead of searching for the meaning in tattoos, one should search for the true self. Something eternal that which was here before you were born and which will remain after you die - true-self.

What should be done to make your relationship more strong?,"I would rephrase the question for better understanding.
What kills the love in a relationship?
The moment one tries to possess other person one turns the other into a thing because only things can be possessed. Only freedom can preserve love or rather if love can give you more freedom then love becomes eternal.
The beauty is in freedom of being. Look at the butterfly it looks beautiful while floating in the air the moment you catch it, it dies.
The key to eternal love is freedom. The love which sprouts out of freedom is divine.

It is said ignorance is the reason for not being enlightened. Does that mean at some point everyone was enlightened before becoming ignorant?,"Ignorance is not the reason for not being enlightened but knowledge is, specifically borrowed knowledge. We are all born enlightened. As in the words of Adyashanti:-
“Enlightenment is a destructive process. It
has nothing to do with becoming better or being happier. Enlightenment is the
crumbling away of untruth. It's seeing
through the facade of pretence. It's the
complete eradication of everything we
imagined to be true.” - Adyashanti
Enlightenment is ‘returning to the source'. Enlightenment is our nature - the natural state.
Lost Eden of our natural state is the cause of our not being enlightened. The natural state - which we have lost, but it can be regained.
Look into the eyes of the child, look and you will see tremendous silence, innocence. Every child comes with a meditative state, but he has to be initiated into the ways of society - he has to be taught how to think, how to calculate, how to use logic, how to argue. He has to be taught concepts, words, language. And slowly, he loses contact with his own innocence, natural state. He becomes polluted and contaminated by society and religion. He becomes an efficient mechanism; he has lost his natural state.
You struggle to regain that silent space once you knew it as a child and you start your search outwards in materialistic things that is why you are not enlightened.
That is why spirituality asks you to go in. Once you turn inward you again find your lost Eden of silence.

Is it possible that existence is our exile and nothingness is our home?,"Mystics have always said, ‘There is no refuge but existence’— there is nowhere to go but in.
One who seeks enlightenment will have to disappear, because no enlightenment, no liberation, is possible without disappearance. Basically, everything you know as ‘I’ is bondage- a noise of the mind. Then how is enlightenment possible until this ‘I’ is dissolved?
Emptiness is our true nature. There is a silent space that is beyond the mind and it is known as no-mind. When you negate everything in your mind you reach emptiness. Emptiness is not negative it is full of beyondness, limitlessness.
Our home is where all the journeys end, where all enlightened beings reach and meet -Silence -emptiness-nothingness.

Is attaining spiritual enlightenment more noble/genuine when one does so out of suffering and poverty or out of giving up a wealthy lifestyle like the Buddha did?,"Nirvana means ‘Blowing out the flame of desires and attachments.’ Becoming is not the concept of Buddha. Emptying all that we know as happiness in this world is the basis of Buddhism. The path of Buddha is the path of negativa.
Is attaining spiritual enlightenment more noble/genuine when one does so out of suffering and poverty or out of giving up a wealthy lifestyle as the Buddha did?
Buddha started seeking out of boredom. Seeking is initiated in the search for eternal truth (happiness). Seeking has nothing to do with what you have. If a rich person renounces 5 million out of 7 million, he has not renounced. If a person is having 10000 and he renounces 10000 he has renounced. Renunciation is state of mind.
Seeking can't be started because of suffering and poverty. Poor people live in hope always expecting God to do a miracle.
Poverty and sufferings are hooks of the material world that keep you clinging to this Maya (illusion)."
"Can someone help me understand why I keep fantasizing or daydreaming about my therapist watching my BF and I be intimate? In the dream, I am fully aware she is present and afterwards I continue the session like nothing happened.","It has something to do with your sexual fantasies.
You are heading towards non-possessiveness. You are being open to sharing your boyfriend that is what you daydream about. It is dancing on your mind.
AND
Your ego is dissolving as your possessiveness is disappearing.
In short, you are getting better."
Enlightened people say that life is already perfect. Is this true?,"Life can't be perfect only death can be perfect.
Imperfection is the essence of life. Look at the irony of human thinking - it is the most imperfect thought thinking life to be perfect.
Life is a mystery to be lived, a quest to explore.
Perfection is an idea with which thousand and one dummy Gods are invented, poignant temples and churches are built."
"If a person has never been spiritual, can they become so as they age and have success finding a like-minded community?","Absolutely Yes, this is where the beauty of being human shines.
Though spirituality is an individual quest it doesn't require community. Religiousness requires a like-minded community. Spirituality is the path of the rebel- the fire.
If one has the seed of rebellion then he can turn spiritual in the nick of time. All who attained liberation were rebellious.
One who doesn't compromise the norms of society and religion, who questions God diligently starts the quest to find his true-self.
And
Most of the time when reality hits hard like the death of loved one anyone can turn spiritual.
Only humans have free will to become an animal, human or divine.
Murderers, rapists are example of humans being animals and Krishna, Buddha and Jesus are examples of humans being divine."
"""Observer is the observed"" isn't it very obvious?","No, who is the observer?
Your mind.
Who will observe?
Your mind.
Who will observe the observer (your mind)?
Your awareness.
Till you transcend your mind and awareness takes the control, your mind will remain the observer.
The day your conscious mind is dropped as an observer then awareness becomes observer and the mind doesn't remain the master.
When the mind is master there is always subject and object but when awareness becomes your nature there is no subject and no object.
Now observer (the mind) is observed (by awareness).
PS: Mind is conscious mind and consciousness is conscious mind + awareness. That means awareness is always working underneath."
Is goodness relative or absolute?,"Goodness is always absolute if it is relative then it is phoney.
Goodness is compassion, the compassion of Buddha where one showers love and affection without discrimination.
No positive emotion is relative. Only negative emotion can be absolutely relative.
Relative goodness is just a possibility that can turn into absolute. Relative goodness is like a window in the wall. With just a bit of understanding, you can find the door to absolute goodness."
Is getting a Buddha tattoo disrespectful?,"Certainly, it is disrespectful to you, not to Buddha.

Who gets the tattoo done - a person who is confused and searching for his or her identity. The tattoo looks great initially but after sometime these tattoos look exactly like old clothes or fashion. Now Tattoo can not be removed so they try to modify it to other designs but the tattoo becomes a headache.
Any tattoo is dust on your consciousness. Any tattoo is a false meaning of your being.

Do animals have souls?,"Animals and birds don't have souls. They are born as animals and birds and die as animals and birds.
Only humans have souls because human have special consciousness. After all, we have freewill to become animal and divine also.
The lion is born as a lion and dies as a lion. Eagle is born as an eagle and dies as an eagle. They have a predefined map.
Only humans have the possibilities to become humans devil or divine.
That is how we had divine souls like Jesus, Krishna and Buddha."
What’s your favorite meditation technique? Which practice do you prefer?,"Surprisingly, there is only one meditation like there is one sleep but we have many dreams. All thousand and one meditation(s) are just dreams or methods.
Marcus Aurelius wrote book meditations. There is no equivalent word to Dhyan ,only word that comes close to Dhyan is meditation (there is no such thing as meditations) in English.
The ultimate alchemy that happens on enlightenment has seeds in meditation. We have three states of mind - waking, dreaming and sleeping. Fourth is not state it is our nature called Turiya. Turiya has something of waking and something of sleeping. Sleeping not in the way we know. Sleeping means state of no-mind. What we know as witnessing in meditation is seed of Turiya. Once you attain the state of no-mind permanently- pure consciousness, all your questions become answers.
Witnessing is the only meditation and you can witness your breathing, your thoughts or your emotions. When you witness your thoughts, there will be gaps between the thoughts and when you keep meditating for years these gaps become larger and larger and one fine day one of the gaps will become permanent and you will enter state of no-mind. One step more you will enter Samadhi. Turiya is permanent Samadhi."
Is the ultimate reality knowing reality?,"Ultimate reality means absolute truth. Our mind puts layer after layer on reality. Because our mind is wired for fictions or stories.
The mind looks out for entertainment even in mundane affairs of life. All the conspiracy theories are proof of a tendency of the mind to be a story animal.
Hindu call this world Maya(illusion), this world is not an illusion but we live in dreams or fiction because of the nature of the mind.
Awakening is the realisation of the nature of mind and going beyond the mind and finding the absolute truth - truth where neither God nor devil remains, where neither sorrows nor happiness remains, where neither sleep nor waking remains.
A.U.M. - ‘Absolute Universal Mind' knows absolute reality."
As an enlightened person are you perfect or do you also have problems in your life like other unenlightened beings?,"For an enlightened person, everybody is enlightened. This enables him to be compassionate for everybody.
Problems are created by the mind and an enlightened being is not identified with the mind (ego).
All the miseries of life are ego-based.
What will Boss think?
What will mother-in-law think?
What will sister-in-law think?
What will people say?
There are thousand and one ways ego is afraid of dying. That is where the miseries are.
One becomes enlightened only when his ego dies and the person is not identified with the ego.
So there are no miseries based on ego.
The answer to your question is ‘YES', enlightened being faces similar problems of life but he is not affected by them."
"Is it okay to love God and have a therapist, or is that just a saying?","Sometimes God itself becomes blockage because God is the subtlest hook of the illusionary world.
Therapists know the energy blockages one may have during the arduous path of transformation.
Sometimes life becomes so hard that meditation becomes just next to impossible. The mind becomes chaos it keeps racing inside the maze of the rabbit hole.
At this point, neither prayer nor meditation works. This is the time you need a therapist more than a God."
I don't feel like talking to people after I meditate. I just feel like being on my own and in my own zone. Why does that happen?,"That means meditation is happening to you. You have found silent inner space.
One who enjoys silence tends to avoid chattering and anything that creates ripples in the space of silence seems like disturbance.
I congratulate you for having found silent space of mind."
I heard in one video Osho said it's completely fine to eat meat but out of asthetics he doesn't allow meat in his ashram. In other video he said it's a sin to eat meat? Can anyone help?,"It is completely fine to eat meat but now your consciousness has asked this question it is not fine for you to eat meat.
Spirituality is the path of compassion and the very idea to kill is disturbing and forget about eating the meat.
Eating meat causes blockage in the heart chakra. I have seen people stuck at heart chakra because of eating meat for decades.
You can eat unfertilized eggs, Osho has advised many times that one should eat unfertilized eggs as egg helps you to obtain proteins not available in vegitables, there is one more reason given by Osho that he noticed there are 40% Jews who have won noble prizes and Jewish people eat eggs in large quantity."
I've been meditating for decades but my third eye is not 100% open. Are there any other factors involved other than meditation?,"To open your third eye you will have to shake away your last hook of the illusionary world - you will have to kill your God. Third eye is seat of your God.
Until you kill your attachment to your God your third eye (Agya Chakra) will not open. God is the subtlest hook of Maya ( illusion). It is the hardest thing to do in the path of kundalini. That is why the opening of the third eye is so rare.
The day you detach yourself from the concept of God your conscious mind will drop and the sensory system gets connected to the subconscious mind.
How would I know that my third eye has opened?
When your third eye is opened then this world looks clearer and more colourful (super HD) and nuke 3D because the third eye gives more depth and non-duality to the vision. The third eye also helps you see miles away as compared to ordinary eyes.
Why does the third eye give almost infallible intuition?
With the opening of the third eye, the sensory system works directly with the subconscious mind and the duality of mind drops so as the fiction part of the mind as words and language of the conscious mind is bypassed and every thought and vision is crystal clear.
Opening of the third eye almost gives you latent powers like no-mind and silence of this very existence.
"
What do good spirits (5th plane+) really want and does radiating gratitude can help them? And can those good spirits helps us in getting What we want by radiating gratitude to them?,"Fifth plane is the first plane of spirituality, all higher planes are divine planes where the God belongs to.
The nature of higher planes is spiritual attributes which helps humans to live a blissful life.
All enlightened beings belong to planes higher than fifth.
When you express gratitude they are bound to give you what you need at that time but if you bug them with demands and wishes then they don't listen."
"Do you believe that a person can have only half of a soul, as in ""split souls""?","There can't be split soul. Soul is whole. One who is close to soul is always whole.
We can have split (dual) personality but split soul is concept popularised by twin flames experts.
In fact our soul is part of cosmic soul so as to say there is only one whole soul and our soul is part of that whole soul.
That is how our soul is eternal because it is part of eternal cosmic soul."
How do I let go of strong egos? It acts like a split personality within.,"What you know as strong ego(s) is insecurities in one or other form of negative emotions.
How can he say this to me?
What do you think you are?
Do you think I need you?
What the hell do you think of me? Am I a sucker?
Why does any Tom, Dick or Harry insult me?
In each of the above statement ego is working in one direction ie, it is afraid to die.
The same energy can be love or hatred.
The same energy can be greed or generosity.
The same energy can be ignorance or wisdom.
According to Buddha, it doesn't matter what you do but the greatest sin is being unconscious while doing it.
And
It is my experience you can't do wrong while being aware or conscious.
To act as a split personality you have to be unconscious.
Be alert, be aware and mindful."
How can one steer away from self deception and delusional thinking? Don't we all live in delusion? We accept a narrative that allows us to function. One reason we have to do this is because we can't know objective reality (i.e. every side of story).,"Mind is deception that is why it requires belief system as a map. Hindu call this world ‘Maya’ - illusion, but actually our objective world is not illusion. Our mind is full of illusions because it enjoys fictions. That is why we accept one or other narrative that allows us to function.
We can’t know objective reality (i.e. every side of story) because our mind works on duality. Our mind has to choose either this or that.
How can one steer away from self deception and delusional thinking?
There are two ways to overcome the limitations of mind :-
Edward De Bono has worked on art of thinking and I found his techniques like Six Thinking hats and Lateral Thinking very valuable.
Other way is Spiritual Awakening where one is awakened from the unconsciousness of the mind and attain the non-dual mind. This is permanent solution to all your thinking problems.
Here first time you use faculties of third eye known as sixth sense. Third eye gives you absolute truth free of all the fictions of conscious mind.
Spiritual awakening is arduous and long process, but certainly possible."
Can enlightened beings have mental illnesses?,"Mental illnesses are disease of the neurotic world of achievements and attachments.
A truly enlightened being is always detached from possessions, achievements and attachments.
When I say ‘detached', I mean they may have all as utilitarian, not as a necessity. He may have money as means, not as a master.
His love is not ordinary love, his love is the love of Buddha where he showers his love on everybody equally. He lives in the market but also aloof from it at the same time.
Enlightened being might get infected, he might get a broken leg but he will never have a mental illness."
"When the kundalini awakens, will it complete the whole process itself or do we have to do? Some sources wrote that it was necessary to learn how to use the kundalini energy. Is this something learned or does the energy act independently?","The key is to cooperate with energy by being witness to thoughts and emotions.
Witnessing to thoughts is optional, but witnessing to emotions is not.
Yes, you should learn to do chakra meditation by using mudras, mantras and visualisation of symbols. Chakra mediation uses core faculties of your mind like hearing, visualisation, contemplation, touch, sense of colors and shapes.
You have to learn to show it the way to ascend otherwise one day it will ascend another day it will become dormant and that is where it causes all the psychological havoc in life."
"If humans had a third eye positioned on the forehead, would things look more 3D? If not, what would it look like?","In fact, humans have a third eye and it can look inward and outward also if it is opened that is how we know the sixth sense. The third eye is our sixth sense.
Here I would like to state that the sixth sense has the most intuitive power. It is like an intuition on steroids.
Yes, if your third eye is opened then this world looks clearer and more colourful (super HD) and nuke 3D because the third eye gives more depth and non-duality to the vision. The third eye also helps you see miles away as compared to ordinary eyes.
Why does the third eye give almost infallible intuition?

Can our ego be our own worst enemy?,"The ego is your worst enemy because it is always afraid of death. It keeps you crippled 24X7.
There are three kinds of deaths;-
Physical death
Emotional death - something inside of you dies on the death of a loved one or the death of a deep relationship.
Psychological death - this is the death of the ego. Which can happen permanently when you are awakened but as the nature of the mind, the ego keeps thinking in one or another way of death and remains terrified.
What will people think?
If I wear a pink dress as a man, what will others say?
What will my boss think?
What will my girlfriend think?
In thousand and one ways, the ego can think of its death.
Now if the death of ego happens you are liberated and you are awakened from a deep sleep, you become whole not separated from existence but it doesn't happen so easily and you keep moving in circles the whole life.
The day ego is dropped you attain your soul, your true self.
That is why ego is considered to be the worst enemy in spirituality."
"Should I read ""Think Like A Monk""?","As a rule of spirituality, you should read anything and everything because you never know what will trigger the awakening.
Spiritual awakening is the path of the unknown and every bit of information you collect is going to help you in one or another way.
I used to read the books of Edwards De Bono to improve my thinking skill and I have been using his methods like ‘Six thinking hats, ‘Six Frames' and Lateral thinking. I used to enjoy the techniques and I fully applied those techniques 11 years. One fine day I found the similarities between the ‘Six thinking hats' and our ‘Chakra System'.
And my love for ‘Six Thinking Hats' paid me off in terms of my Kundalini Awakening up to 7th chakra in one GO.
So make it a rule read anything that catches your fancy.

"Why is your ego your biggest enemy, and how do you beat it?","The ego is your biggest enemy because it is always afraid of death. It keeps you crippled 24X7. No matter what you do you keep getting frustrated in the end.

Physical death
Emotional death - something inside of you dies on the death of a loved one or the death of a deep relationship.

"Some people who have had ""spiritual awakening"" have talked of their mind being quiet, with one person (Jean pool) on Quora stating that he had felt his mind was 80% quieter (or something like that). Is this everyone's experience or?","‘80% quieter mind’ is something absurd. Either there is mind or no-mind. Mind means restlessness, noise and chaos. No-mind means stillness, silence. There is no percentage of awakening. Either you reach home or you are traveling without direction, because before awakening everything is maddening.
This is the very nature of the awakening to be totally silent (100% silent). I don’t read his answers but if this is what Jean Pool said , “80% quieter” then he is yet not awakened.
One can’t say my leg has reached home and my rest of body is about to reach. Either you are awakened without any string or you are groping in dark."
How can one take action without judging? Is it necessary to judge things? How can one judge if their knowing is limited?,"You can live your life by head or you can live your life by heart.
If you live your life by head then you will have to judge things before taking action.
If you live your life by heart there will be no need to judge, your heart will show you the way.
Even when you take action based on sheer logic(head), your final decision is always based on emotions (heart) but ego gets satisfaction that it has played great deal of role in your decision.
And
Remember when your ego takes a decision it is always based on negative emotion.
It is always better to live your life by heart."
"Is Chögyal Namkhai Norbu correct when he says our life is unreal and that Buddha taught that life is just like a dream (Mahayana, Tibetan Buddhism, sunyata, dreams, Buddhism)?","Life is a dream because you live unconsciously with thousand and one things on your mind.
Your mind is always calculating, manipulating and planning. Mind is everywhere but not in present.
The very nature of the mind is to cling to the past and imagine about the future. You are hypnotised by one thing or other.
You see a beautiful girl, you start dreaming of making love to her, now you are hypnotised by her beauty. Is your dream real?
There is a popular Buddhist parable:-

The story goes that two monks were traveling together, a senior and a junior. They came to a river with a strong current where a young woman was waiting, unable to cross alone. She asks the monks if they would help her across the river. Without a word and in spite of the sacred vow he’d taken not to touch women, the older monk picks her up, crosses, and sets her down on the other side.
The younger monk joins them across the river and is aghast that the older monk has broken his vow but doesn’t say anything. An hour passes as they travel on. Then two hours. Then three. Finally, the now quite agitated younger monk can stand it no longer: “Why did you carry that women when we took a vow as monks not to touch women?”
The older monk replies, “I set her down hours ago by the side of the river. Why are you still carrying her?”
That is how we live our life unconsciously, utterly sleepy.

How does mind work in an awakened person? Does the mental chatter still continue and they don't pay attention or is there no chatter?,"Awakened person always rests in no-mind. There isn't a ripple of unwanted thoughts, because there isn't any ‘I' or ego. Most of the mental chatter happens because of the ‘ego'. Ego is always afraid of one or other thing like what will people think? What will my boss think? What will my girlfriend think? Ego is afraid of dying.
Awakened one uses his mind (or thinks) when he speaks or writes otherwise he acts like an observer on the peak, looking down into the Valley.
There is one more quality that is available to awakened one that he is always in waking-sleep.
One downside is also there he is not able to learn new things he is only capable of doing something he used to do the best before awakening."
Why should self-love be a priority?,"One who can't love herself is bound to pretend that she loves you.You can give in proportion to what you have.
Certainly self-love is the only lesson you can learn from spirituality.
Without you there will be no sky, no stars, no sun, no moon and no earth.
What you know as ‘I' is a world in itself.
Recently I have been to emergency ward, everywhere I saw there was life only death seemed to happen to those who don't live this beautiful life one who lives life fully for him death becomes just another door to start yet another journey.
Life in itself is God."
Can you be enlightened without knowing what enlightenment is?,"Enlightenment can only happen to the one who doesn't know what is enlightenment.
Because enlightenment happens beyond the mind and whatsoever can be known by the mind can't be Enlightenment.
Mind is a self-sufficient ecosystem of thoughts, perceptions and logics. The mind can create logic out of illogics. Its ability to create a dream out of a dream that not being in a dream is enormous. Mind either denies incomprehensible or creates equivalent imagination (substitute) to its understanding and enlightenment is incomprehensible for the mind. Mind is full of fiction or mind is fiction in itself.
Enlightenment can only happen to one who doesn't know, who doesn't care and who doesn't seek enlightenment.
Those who strive for enlightenment never attain enlightenment."
"Whenever I meditate, I go into a trance after sometimes I'm not sleeping nor awake. Is it okay to be like that?","What you are calling a ‘trance' is an Alpha state of mind. It is the first meditative state of mind.
This state of mind has pleasing contents and you enjoy it like a movie.
Congrats your journey to deeper states of meditation has begun.
If you keep meditating then you will have access to deeper states of meditation known as Theta and Delta."
How did you fully forgive your childhood abusers with compassion if they are your relatives to let go of hurt and to feel at peace for your own well being?,"There is answer in your question - to feel at peace and for your own well being you just have to forgive everybody without discrimination.
One of the most fundamental message of forgiveness is given by Jesus.
You don't have to read full Bible to understand Jesus, just when your forgiveness comes out of understanding then you have found the peace in every moment.
I would like to add that before you forgive anybody you will have to forgive yourself first."
Alan Watts said never force anything. How do I know if I am forcing or not?,"The only indicator to know that you are forcing things is your anger.
Anger happens when you want something and someone is not allowing you to have it whether it is possession of a material thing or person.
Most of the time it is more frustrating to try to possess a person and here one forces things. Every person is entitled to have freedom but when we get into relation we tend to possess person's life and his/her decisions.
In other matters where the object is material we easily settle for alternatives."
Would it be fair to say that our struggles in life come from our inability to figure out exactly who we are and why we exist?,"Lost Eden of our natural state is the cause of our struggle. The natural state - which we have lost, but it can be regained.
Look into the eyes of the child, look and you will see tremendous silence, innocence. Every child comes with a meditative state, but he has to be initiated into the ways of society - he has to be taught how to think, how to calculate, how to use logic, how to argue. He has to be taught concepts, words, language. And slowly, he loses contact with his own innocence, natural state. He becomes polluted and contaminated by society and religion. He becomes an efficient mechanism; he has lost his natural state.
You struggle to regain that silent space once you knew as a child and you start your search outwards in materialistic things that is why you struggle.
When you know meditation first time, you will be surprised - because a great feeling will arise in you as if you know it before and ‘YES’ you knew it as a child. That is why all searches end when you turn inside.
That is why spirituality asks you to go in."
"What if enlightenment (in spiritual context, not religious) is just a myth perpetuated by spiritual leaders to run their enterprise?","The only truth in spirituality is ‘enlightenment'. Reincarnation, soul, God, heaven, hell and all other thousand and one things are just devices to attain the blissful state of superconsciousness.
There is one more truth no spiritual leader can give you enlightenment. Enlightenment is a pretty personal journey.
What worked for Buddha wouldn't have worked for Mahavira.
Enlightenment is a personal quest for the truth of your being."
What is the spiritual purpose of there being so many Narcissist in our world? Is it good vs evil. Are they another intra human species. They are different anatomically. What are your thoughts on this?,"Narcissists are utterly primitive species of humans. This is a genetic disorder commonly found in males.
They live the whole of their life unconsciously. They are spiritually empty. They are cowards, they don't dare to look inside of themselves. Their disorders are because of their ancestors. Their ancestors must have been some highly deprived people, that is why they try to behave like a person who has an excessive interest in or admiration of themselves and think the world revolves around them.
You will hardly find narcissists from Royal families. Even if you find one he will turn into a spiritual person in the later stage of life.
If you look at the history you will find most of the enlightened beings like Buddha, Mahavira, 24 Tirthankara of Jainism were from royal families."
Why do some people report having spiritual experiences and psychological shifts while practicing intense and forceful breathing?,"Beautiful question from beautiful lady.
Mind and breath are interconnected. A change in breathing affects a corresponding change in state of mind. For instance, it is impossible for a man to be angry if he keeps his breathing steady and calm.
Breathing is the bridge between body and soul. Anything you do to breathing will stir your kundalini.
All yoga Guru actually harm people by not issuing warning about the kundalini dangers.
If you want to live peaceful life never ever muddle with breathing it can create havoc in your mental balance.
Maharishi Pitanjali in his text of Yoga Sutra has mentioned dangers of Pranayama or any change in discipline of breathing."

Existence is a very bad photocopier. Everybody is born as a masterpiece. So, you get the answer “NO' but that also tells you that you have possibilities beyond your perceptions about your grandfather.
People waste time in becoming someone else. Why can't you be yourself?
Your love for your grandfather is appreciated, but try to be yourself.
My mind thoughts are about him every day?
I feel sorry about the loss of your grandfather but that also should make you think that what can you give your grandfather as a great human being.
Something that will make him proud.
Don't feel sad. Don't let him die inside of you. His presence will always shine as the light on the path.
"
Do your past fears surface when you are experiencing spiritual growth?,"Repression is avoidance of fear and that is what is uncovered in spiritual awakening.
As Buddha said - Awakening is the work of millions of lives.
Every time I start to work with people who are stuck in ‘ Dark Night of the soul ‘, I find it true.
Many people aren't even aware of DNTS and they lead very painful life. My heart just beats for them.
DNTS is very difficult to come through because it is the last stoppage of the dual world.
DNTS is a spirit world where you redefine your fears to the extremity of hallucination. Where you meet your angels, devil, beautiful witches and your forefathers. You also get a chance to dine with your late grandmother. Some keep moving in circles calling all that bad experiences - spiritual experiences.
Some spend whole life talking to their so-called spirit guides.
Now, this is too much - STOP THAT! Though I also like hobbits.
LISTEN TO ME, YES I AM YELLING…everything you know as reality is your reality and your mind is full of fiction. Fiction can create fiction to understand fiction, this is a nested loop. BUT…
What is absolute truth?
Absolute truth means where no fiction of mind remains you experience reality - the truth as it is.
That is what I call ‘Awakening'."
"Is loving yourself, i.e., loving the world and loving the almighty God?","Certainly loving yourself is the only lesson you can learn from spirituality.
Without you there will be no sky, no stars, no sun, no moon and no earth.
What you know as ‘I' is a world in itself.
I am writing this answer from the emergency ward everywhere I see there is life only death seems to happen to those who don't live this beautiful life one who lives life fully for him death becomes just another door to enter yet another journey.
Life in itself is God."
"Are there any ways to gain interest in life and in usual things, after a spiritual awakening or in the dark night of the soul?","How can one overcome ‘dark night of the soul'?
There is one way to be in present and Now. Just find peace in doing small things where you lose sense of time and place.
When I was going through DNTS I used to sing and dance like crazy. Sometimes I used to cook a meal for myself and others.
I still find DNTS beautiful in the sense you don't care about what other people will think. You become immortal in DNTS."
What does the “true self” of a narcissist typically look like?,"“True-self” of anybody in the same narcissist is no exception.
But the distance is wide narcissist can't even dare to look inside.
The narcissist is a coward because he is afraid of himself.
Narcissist is utterly unconscious of himself. He leads sleepy life.
He needs compassion and love to make him look inside.
If one can understand the inner tussle of a narcissist then narcissist can be changed to human."
"What is your reflection about this quotation, “Immersion in the scriptures is essential for spiritual nourishment”?","Immersion in scripture is an outward journey and it is natural for anybody with an intellectual brain.
Mind understands ‘running' and scriptures are good track to run on. But where will you reach by running? Of course, away from yourself, where else? You will keep moving in circles and that is what material life is all about.
Spiritual life is an inward journey where all the laws of the material world are reversed then only you reach your true-self.
There is nothing to read, there is nowhere to go, but in."
I have met few yoga teachers who claim to have awakened their kundalini but they still have issues in their material life and they can't find the right solutions. What can be the reason behind that?,"Awakening of kundalini is very common and there are almost 1/4th people in the world with awakened kundalini at one or other point of time.
But the question is awakened kundalini up to which chakra?
Till Kundalini completes the journey up to the seventh chakra (Sahasrara chakra) it keeps ascending and descending and creates havoc in the life of the person.
And the tragedy is no one can have fully awakened kundalini while living in Samsara.
When one attains Nirvana then only Kundalini is stabilised in Sushumna Nadi and the person lives enlightened life otherwise Kundalini keeps moving and resting dormant for a major part of the time.
The awakening of kundalini and living enlightened life are two different things."
What chakra do you struggle with opening?,"The heart chakra is very difficult to open and people struggle for decades with it. This situation is also called ‘dark night of the soul.’
The reason for this is we tend to be closed with doubts and doubts close your tendency to forgive. Even if you forgive others you can't forgive yourself.
Forgiveness opens your heart chakra and third eye simultaneously.
Trust, forgiveness and gratitude open your heart, throat and third eye."
"The enlightened beings ask us ""to witness"". They also ask us ""to experience"". Why this contradiction?","You can experience something as ‘I' and say - “I saw it with my own eyes.” Here you feel - The great I am.
You can also experience something as witness- now you are playing God.
I don't see any confusion. Do you?"
Can you eliminate the constant thoughts about how others perceive you?,"They went along amid the laughter of all who met them till they came to Market Bridge, when the Donkey, getting one of his feet loose, kicked out and caused the Boy to drop his end of the pole. In the struggle the Donkey fell over the bridge, and his fore-feet being tied together he was drowned.
“That will teach you,” said an old man who had followed them:
“Please all, and you will please none.”
From Aesop Fable:-
“The Man, the Boy, and the Donkey”
Can you change the perception of other by thinking about it or by even changing yourself?
“Please all, and you will please none.”

"In spirituality they says this 'me' is nothing but a thoughts. Now being a thought myself, is it possible for a thought (me) to become aware or observe itself and again, can it see its own limitation that it is limited? If it sees then is that truth?","‘Me' is the mind's ‘I' and our identification with ‘I' is an illusion when we take various roles in life.
When you say ‘I' you mean what you think as ‘I' is something you consider you are. Ego is shifting sands.
When you are at home you are husband, when you talk to your servant you are boss, when you are in office you are a servant to your boss.
Thought can create thought so a dream can create a dream. Mind is so powerful that it can create the dream of not being in a dream.
Mind denies the incomprehensible, it can lie to itself but acceptance of defeat is out of point.
Absolute Truth can only be seen by transcending mind - by attaining no-mind."
How does distance energy healing work?,"98% of time distance energy healing doesn’t work. It is really a mind game. It is rare if the real-touch healing is working, what to talk of distant energy healing.
1.5% of time it is your inner capacity that can be uncovered and used as healing source from remote.
0.5% it can work if somebody can make the connection on the soul level and he becomes the egoless medium for the divine to heal you but in that case divine is everywhere that is too not distant healing.
So there is no such thing as distant healing it is all the game of projecting mind in the internet era."
"Is the ego what we call “self,” and is it an illusion?","Ego is the mind's ‘I' and our identification with ego is an illusion.
When you say ‘I' you mean what you think as ‘I' is something you consider you are. Ego is shifting sands.
When you are at home you are husband, when you talk to your servant you are boss, when you are in office you are a servant to your boss.

There are six layers of the ego (personality) and when we meditate for many years the layers are peeled like peeling an onion.
List of layers :-
Layer ONE : In this people live artificial life like if they go to funeral they cry with others but their tears mean nothing. They say Hello but to avoid people. Frederick S. Perls has called this layer CHICKENSHIT.
Layer TWO : This layer is pure ego. It is like - I AM PRESIDENT OF AMERICA. I AM HUSBAND OF MISS UNIVERSE. People in this layer are bit better than layer one but dangerous because they become politicians, police officers etc. Frederick S. Perls has called this layer BULLSHIT.
Layer THREE: When something bad happens in layer two like death of loved one or divorce then people like poets, authors, musicians, lyricists or people good at heart fall to third layer. This layer is called CHAOS. Here people either become alcoholic or druggist or go back to layer two.If one remains meditative and aware then he enters next layer.
Layer FOUR: This is DEATH layer ,where you touch death experiences of yourself and your loved one.If one remains aware in this layer by meditating then he or she enters LIFE phase. To be frank, in this layer you need a MASTER who can give birth to your new ego otherwise you will move like zombie or you will revert to layer two.When this layer is being peeled this is Awakening of Heart Chakra. This is also called 'dark night of the soul'. This term was first mentioned in a poem written by the 16th-century Spanish mystic and poet St. John of the Cross. From here you are most likely to descend or transcend. Be careful and remain aware.
Layer FIVE: This layer is called LIFE. Your new ego has to take new form and new dimensions of loving and compassionate life. You can become Epicurious or Buddha if you remain aware. From here MASTER can't help you. You will be guided by your wisdom.
Layer SIX: This layer is called BLISS. If you come to this layer then you have the possibility of becoming BUDDHA- full of pure love and awareness.
Break the shell of every layer before you experience Enlightenment.

What is the great irony of enlightenment?,"The great irony of enlightenment is ‘there is nothing to attain.’
To be enlightened we have to empty our mind of all identifications we know as ‘I'.
In fact, what we seek outside is residing inside. People go to the Himalayas, people go to the monastery in the search of enlightenment.
But there is nowhere to go, but in.
Enlightenment is an inner journey."
What is the specialty of Rudraksh Mala in Hinduism? Does it benefit spiritually?,"Nothing outside of you can help you to grow spiritually. Spirituality is an inward journey.
One can go to the Himalayas or to the the monastery. One can go to a temple or church. All outer journeys lead to material things. All roads lead to Rome.
Every ‘object' you think is spiritual is actually material. There is nothing to buy, there is nowhere to go, but in."
Do you think that we have free will or not?,"Birds can't be enlightened. Animals can’t be enlightened. They don't have freewill. Lion will die as lion only.
Only humans have freewill. Humans can become animals or divine also. Assassins and rapists are examples of becoming animals. Whereas Krishna, Jesus, Buddha are the example of humans becoming divine.
Enlightenment of animals is like enlightenment of kids. They are awake but they are unconscious.
Enlightenment is more of a journey from false to truth, from darkness to light, from death to deathlessness,
It is our freewill that allows us to be anything, anytime."
How has meditation changed your life?,"Meditation is the mean, not the end.
Restlessness is the very nature of the mind. The mind can be anywhere but not in present. Meditation is something beyond mind. Meditation can help you reduce your erratic thoughts. But still, thoughts will remain.
Meditation is one and crucial part of the inner work. Meditation alone can not ensure inner peace. If meditation is making you a bit silent then meditation is not working on you.
Meditation should shake you, it should give you a dark night of the soul. Inner peace can not be ascertained till your mind remains. It will be one day peaceful other day hell. Inner alchemy happens when you attain no-mind.
I totally disagree with people who keep meditating for decades. They have not worked on inner transformation. They have missed the point.
The only purpose of meditation is to transcend meditation when your life becomes a meditation. You don't sit even for 3 minutes to attain inner peace. Inner peace prevails in every moment of life. Meditation happens in every moment of life. Your walking is meditation, your eating is meditation and your sleeping is meditation. You become a meditation.
NOW, I am the meditation.
"
"How did Buddha attain enlightenment when there was no one to give him empowerments, and could others achieve enlightenment in the same way?","“You have to move on. I am only a teacher, not a master. I was pretending and I am very sorry!” said Buddha’s master. Buddha was totally shattered and tired.
He went to take a dip in a nearby river, Niranjana. It is a very small river; in the summer it is not even one foot deep. And he was taking a bath, but he was so weak that he could not cross that small current. He had to hang onto a branch of a tree for a few moments to gather some energy so that he could get out of the river. He felt like cheated in the name of enlightenment.
That experience made it clear to him there is no enlightenment.
Though denying to be real master can only be claimed by the real master, according to me Buddha’s master was real courageous master who declared himself charlatan.
Buddha’s last hook of attachment and of desire to be enlightened disappeared in one stroke.
His enlightenment came out of desirelessness and enlightenment can happen to anyone who’s seeking has ended.

How do you know if you find your true self?,"Vicky Abraham, this question is most difficult to answer for someone who has really found his true-self.
Take it from me all other 20+ answers are from people who didn't understand your question and those 40+ upvotes are also from the people who don't know what you are referring to as true-self.
And that is why you have not upvoted any of the answers.
Let me try:-
Mind is full of fictions and chaos and it can never experience absolute truth. The day your mind drops and you attain no-mind, you attain permanent silence.
In that deep silence free of the noise of the mind, you come to know your true -self."
What is the difference between thoughtless state (i.e live blindly and dont think at all) and no-thought state (rise beyond all thoughts and live in enlightenment) how do one know he is in thoughtless or no-thought state?,"There is no such state as a thoughtless or no-thought state. Mind means thoughts, chaos or restlessness.
There is mind or no-mind. No-mind is Theta state of mind. Self-realized person shifts between mind and no-mind at will.
There is yet another state which is beyond the states of human consciousness. The fourth - Turiya - the state of samadhi.
Turiya is not a state of mind, it is our true nature - the nature of this universe.
Turiya - the waking-sleep.
One who is rooted in Turiya permanently is enlightened.
Or
Turiya is God's State."
Can any spiritual changes or awakening affect the menstrual cycle?,"Yes, absolutely.
Any spiritual change can cause physiological change ranging from a skin problem to severe headaches.
Whenever one advances in spirituality then the brain is rewired for the new adjustments. When there are changes in the brain then the brain requires an excessive flow of blood just like it happens in any brain or heart surgery. Now the brain has only one way to procure excess blood I.e. by pumping your heart faster.
Now with every change in the brain, there is a corresponding change in other functions of the body which also includes the menstrual cycle.
The answer is ‘YES'.
Disclaimer: This is strictly not medical advice."
"Can you identify higher souls like you or the person who is trying to become a higher soul, and if you can, will you help them?","There is no higher or lower soul.
The soul is one and we all are part of that soul. The soul is eternal, which can't be created or destroyed. The very nature of the soul includes compassion, forgiveness and gratitude. Being good or bad is the matter of realization of the soul.
This is experienced in deep recesses of samadhi and all enlightened beings tried to explain this unexplainable.
As mystics say, “We are spiritual beings (part of soul) having a human experience.”"
Who are higher souls? How can one identify them?,"There is no higher or lower soul.
The soul is one and we all are connected to that soul. The soul is eternal, which can't be created or destroyed. The very nature of the soul includes compassion, forgiveness and gratitude. Being good or bad is the matter of realization of the soul.
This is experienced in deep recesses of samadhi and all enlightened beings tried to explain this unexplainable.
As mystics say, “We are spiritual beings (part of soul) having a human experience.”"
Why do spiritualists claim the soul has a DNA structure? Is there any perfect evidence?,"The soul is one and we all are connected to that soul. You may call it cosmic consciousness.
The soul is eternal, which can't be created or destroyed. The very nature of the soul includes compassion, forgiveness and gratitude.
This is experienced in deep recesses of samadhi and all enlightened beings tried to explain this unexplainable.
As mystics say, “We are spiritual beings having a human experience.”"
What is your opinion regarding enlightenment techniques told by Santata Gamana in his books and website?,"Santata Gamana is not real name. Nobody has seen him. What can you expect from someone who is not disclosing his identity?
Only Truth can breed truth. I have never seen a single enlightened master hiding behind some pseudo-identity.
Even if his techniques are good (which is not the case) it is not going to work because only the presence and words of the enlightened master stir your inner space.
Real alchemy happens when you know where these words are coming from. It is a matter of connection. People connect to the personality of the voice.
There is something powerful about focusing on one person. For example Have you ever watched a report from a disaster scene? The reporter talks about the terrible loss of life and devastation and you think, ‘How awful.’ But it's not until the camera turns onto a child, standing desolate in the ruins of his home with no idea where his parents are, that really affects you.
We are wired to connect to individuals, not concepts.
Read any enlightened master and then read Santata Gamana. You will know the difference.
Update:- I studied his book titles, those are sheer waste of time. One of his titles is on lucid dreaming - I thought to myself, “If one can talk of enlightenment via lucid dreaming then, of course, he hasn't found absolute truth because lucid dreaming is the second and third plane of reality - it is simply impossible to reach absolute truth via lucid dreaming.”"
Do enlightened people imagine things?,"They don’t imagine or they imagine rarely. Imagination belongs to past and future and enlightened being lives HERE and NOW.
He doesn’t even care for next meal what else to talk about. If he gets something to eat that is all matters to him. He doesn’t choose flavor of the ice-cream. He will simply have what is available.
Enlightenment means being free of imagination - good or bad doesn’t matter."
How do enlightened people witness hunger?,"When enlightened person witnesses the hunger then he doesn't need food at all for weeks.
This is due to a change in the physiology of the enlightened person. He can get energy from the Moon directly and survive.
There are many instances where a woman or man hasn't had food for decades.
If you search on google there is a lady who hasn't had water for 25 years."
"Does a spiritually enlightened person make mistakes? If so, does he/she feel regret?","An enlightened person don't make mistakes - did you see? I made one mistake.
He doesnt make mistake on human grounds because he love everybody more than himself- I made one more mistake!
Let me correct all the grammatical mistakes.
An enlightened person doesn't make mistakes on the emotional ground as he loves everybody equally."
How does the subconscious work? Who controls the subconscious?,"Subconscious mind has hard wired survival responses. Fight or flight , love or hate, jealousy or compassion, sad or happy. Value system of subconscious mind is based on emotions and this is what we get as our DNA from ancestors.
Conscious mind decodes these responses of subconscious mind into thoughts and tries to make sense in physical world and chooses rational option.
Conscious mind value system is based on rational interpretation of experience."
Was Jay Shetty actually a monk?,"Absolutely, he is a monk……………..a failed monk.
A monk who failed to attain enlightenment and became a motivational speaker.
It doesn't matter you read ‘Monk who sold his Ferrari' or ‘Think like a Monk'. It is all games of mind.
Every week new flavour. You keep looking for the next new thing or book. You keep moving in circles. You might find some golden nuggets here and there. But they will work for some time.
Intelligent people search for the ultimate, the eternal that is which you will never lose - your true-self."
How does a born-awakened one know that he is already awakened?,"There is no such thing as born-awakened. You have mistaken the statement - “You are already awakened.”
This statement is used in the final round of awakening by the master to short-circuit the search and then the ego drops once it understands the search for awakening is useless as I am already awakened.
You are largely deluded and massively illusioned.
You are not awakened by any sense. Those answers below and above my answer are the answers from similarly deluded people.
Awakening is not something that requires confirmation or certification.
An awakened person is respected even by the birds and animals. He carries a climate around him.
His just one look can transform the person.
How many awakened do we know?
Very few.
Awakening is as rare as Krishna, Buddha and Jesus."
Do most “enlightened “ people go through hardship and what’s the connection to difficulties and enlightenment?,"Enlightenment is the process of death and resurrection.
Even Birth is not painless then what to talk of death.
All that you know as life has to be buried. Death of ego can't be a cakewalk. What happens in death exactly that happens in enlightenment.
Physical death can be easier than psychological death - the death of ego.
In physical death, you don't have to come back to the market but in enlightenment, you have to return to the market and live life with a new set of rules.
The process of enlightenment gives you ‘dark night of the soul' and you live on the verge of madness for years or you can say you go through dark nights full of ghosts.
‘Hardship' is a relatively light word to what happens in enlightenment.
After enlightenment, everything seems meaningful but before enlightenment, everything is a mess."
"Why do we need compassion, and how does it affect spiritual growth?","Compassion has something to do with you not others. Spirituality requires a simplified mind.
Compassion doesn't only include your present it also includes your past and future.
Compassion includes forgiveness. Compassion includes gratitude. Compassion includes surrender.
Compassion is unconditional and this very quality of compassion sets you free of all the burdens mind creates out of the insecurities of life."
"'Out beyond the ideas of right doing and wrong doing, there's a field I will meet you there' what does this phase means?","The very idea of wrong and right belongs to the mind.
There is a field that is beyond the mind and it is known as no-mind. When you negate everything in your mind you reach emptiness. Emptiness is not negative it is full of beyondness, limitlessness.
It doesn't matter how beautifully one strings words it is always a noise of the mind.
Empty of all the words and language there is a silent space - Rumi is waiting for you there, where all the journeys end.
Rumi will meet you where all enlightened beings reach - Silence.
"
"Why were realised beings Buddha, Mahavira, Swami Vivekananda, and even Osho against the marriage institution? Why do they always say to walk alone?","Marriage is a social institution and it is not real. While love is a natural human affair.
While being in a marriage and with kids, you can't advance in spirituality. Desires and attachments keep you clinging to the material world.
They are against marriage but not against love and sex. If you can love without trying to possess other person then love is not bondage. Very idea of marriage is very inhuman because it reduces two persons to things and then game of ego starts.
Path of spirituality is path of aloneness, not loneliness. There is a difference between aloneness and loneliness. Loneliness is ugly a situation of neediness whereas aloneness is beautiful company of yourself. Where you enjoy yourself without depending on other person.
Whole spirituality can be reduced to one word - aloneness."
How do I meditate? Many thoughts rush when I close my eyes. What do I do?,"This situation happens when your mind is at extreme unrest. This situation is the situation of extreme anxiety.
Your mind requires something to do 24X7. We need to put it to the mode of boredom then you will be able to meditate.
Understanding the source of anxiety will also put your mind to rest.
If you are having life-threatening fear then you must resolve it first or accept it.
There are three kinds of life-threatening fears:-
Physical body death.
Emotional death - end of a deep emotional relation or death of loved one.
Psychological (ego) death.
Most of the time death of the ego is the main source of anxiety, which is obviously not real. When we completely start getting identified with our ego then we start to remain under fear of what others will think or say. We start taking actions according to other people and always ignore our individuality.
You just have to return to yourself first, look in the mirror and ask yourself:-
Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?
Till your mind become calm.
Now start meditation by witnessing:-
Sit comfortably and close your eyes. Hear (not listen) to sounds you hear for 15 minutes.
Slowly, slowly you will be able to meditate. Meditation means witnessing. Meditation is neither concentrating nor contemplating."
"When a worldly person pursues spiritual path, the mind is not as stable as a monk on the same pursuit . What suggestions would be helpful to the worldly person to attain same speed as a monk?","The spiritual path can be pursued in its totality only by a worldly person and any spiritual accomplishment can only be enjoyed by a worldly person.
Becoming a monk is the source of all kind of repressions. Repression is the cause of homosexuality. You can see their plastic smile and eyes full of lust.
Anything that can't be maintained in the material world is of little value. If you don't experience life in its totality then the depth of your spirituality will be only skin deep.
Easy come and easy go."
Is it possible for an enlightened person to be arrogant?,"An enlightened person can be anything but he doesn't get identified with it.
He remains still and separated from what he does. He can take any form but still remains unaffected.
What an enlightened person can't be is more important than what he can be.
An enlightened person can't be selfish. An enlightened person can't be greedy. An enlightened person can't be jealous. An enlightened person can't be heartless.
His main concern will be you not himself."
How do you stay optimistic and happy after realizing there is no God or heaven?,"It is impossible to be happy without God. God is not something above the 7th sky. God is a hope and hope is what keeps you alive.
Without God you will remain fearful and confused. God is your father figure.
If you deny God then you will have to replace your God with something else.
I have replaced my God with meditation. Meditation keeps us conscious and aware otherwise we are bound to become neurotic without God."
"When I am a witness, the mind stops. When the mind is there, witnessing stops. Why does that happen?","Witnessing is the bridge between consciousness and awareness. Let's understand the difference between consciousness and awareness.
Consciousness = conscious mind + awareness.
Consciousness has subject and object. That means there will be a conscious mind that is in action.
Awareness doesn't have either subject or object. Awareness is free of two but active as an observer at peak.
Witnessing or observing is a bridge to attain awareness as our permanent nature. Witnessing does have a subject but there is no object.
Awareness is the fabric of our universe. When you witness then there will be a gap between thoughts and that is where you touch awareness for a few milliseconds and that is where the meditation happens. When you keep meditating one fine day one of the gaps will become permanent and you will attain no-mind (awareness).
One step more you will attain Samadhi. Samadhi is a state of turiya (the fourth). Turiya is beyond the states of human consciousness.
Turiya is known as God's State.

Turiya is waking-sleep.
There is yet another realisation of the supreme self beyond Turiya - Turyatita -The non-doing - Vikarma.

What makes people say Jiddu Krishnamurthi was enlightened?,"Jiddu Krishnamurti never claimed that he was enlightened. In fact, he always denied there is something called enlightenment. Jiddu Krishnamurti was a very honest human being so he never lied. That what I love him for.
I have seen many of his videos in one of the videos on asking a question about enlightenment he refuted unexpectedly and said, “Enlightened about what?”
Neither J. Krishnamurti nor UG Krishnamurti mentioned their date and place of enlightenment unlike Osho and Ramana Maharishi.
He lived on the borderline of being mystic but not enlightened.

How does one know if it's their intuition and not the mind's chatter?,"Intuition is always felt at heart without thoughts.
Whenever I have to use intuition I put my hand at heart and feel the query- if my heart starts racing I know good will happen, but if I feel my mind has started chattering I come to know- my intuition has failed.
But to help intuition to work you need to live by heart otherwise you will always be cheated by mind."
Do you feel that animals might be the enlightened ones? They live in tune with the earth. They live in the moment. They take what they need and nothing more. They seem to be happy that way when humans don't interfere with them.,"Animals can't be enlightened. They don't have free will. Lion will die as lion only. Only humans have free will.
Humans can become animals or divine also. Assassins and rapists are examples of becoming animals. Whereas Krishna, Jesus, Buddha are the example of humans becoming divine.
Enlightenment of animals is like enlightenment of kids. They are awake but they are unconscious.
Enlightenment is more of a journey from false to truth, from darkness to light, from death to deathlessness,"
How will you identify an enlightened person?,"There is no need to verify enlightened being because their very presence can be felt by the people. They carry a climate with them. Even birds and animals can feel their presence.
If you have to verify the enlightened being then most probably you are trying to confirm his enlightenment or you are trying to disqualify him as enlightened being.
In either of the cases you are using your mind, to verify you have to be open and you have to be observant of his presence by heart. If you don’t feel his silence then most probably he is not enlightened."
"Hi! Can Kundalini Shakti be ‘controlled’ if I am not initiated? I come out of meditative experiences due to fear, and feeling like I am ‘slipping’, I get a bit scared. Thank you 🙏🏾","Kundalini can be reverted till heart chakra - 4th Chakra.
If Kundalini has touched the 5th Chakra - Throat Chakra then it will be impossible to revert it. It may become dormant but it will start travelling upward whenever you go into a relaxed state.
If you don't meditate and remain occupied then no residue energy will be available to kundalini to ascend.
If you keep thinking about food and sex then your kundalini will become dormant permanently.
It is all about how you live your life.
Hack : Exercise daily especially lower body exercises like Squat, Deadlift and lunges."
Why do Buddhists care if they are enlightened?,"Buddhists never use the word ‘enlightenment'. Buddhists know the word - Nirvana.
Nirvana means ‘Blowing out the flame of desires and attachments.’ Becoming is not the concept of Buddha. Emptying all that we know as happiness in this world is basis of Buddhism.Path of Buddha is path of negativa.
Enlightenment is the word used by modern spiritual masters. There is nothing to be enlightened about.
Buddhists believe the cycle of birth and death can only be broken by attaining Nirvana. That is what Buddha taught for more than 4 decades.

"What did Rumi mean when he said ""Out beyond ideas of right doing and wrong doing, there is a field and I will meet you there""?","The very idea of wrong and right belongs to the mind.

When you negate everything in your mind you reach emptiness. Emptiness is not negative it is full of beyondness, being limitless.

"How can one decide about the quality of a religion before converting, on its holy book or it's C class followers?","Religion is a prison. What prison you choose hardly matters. It is like born Christian and die Buddhist.
Prison is prison whether it is made of iron or gold doesn't matter.
It is our mind that wanders in search of the next best thing.
People go to the Himalayas in search of truce but when they come back into the market they are the same old person.
One should accept what he is, he shouldn't run after glittering gold. Every golden thing is not gold."
Can hypertension and diabetes in the middle age be controlled if we recite the Gita verse 'Sukhadukhe samekritva Labhalabhou jayajayou----' daily with meaning in the early morning?,"Yes, any mantra which you find soothing will work magic. But remember to change the mantra every 6 weeks.
Whatsoever you do for long time mind gets used to of it and it loses its effectiveness.
There is a secret to the mantra chanting that it has to be followed by witnessing.
Mantra chanting will calm your mind and witnessing will silence your mind."
Was the introductory Ashtavakra Gita written before the Bhagavad Gita?,"Yes, it was written even before Ramayana. King Janak got enlightened just by listening to Ashtavakra.
King Janak in Ashtavakra Gita was the father of Sita, the wife of Rama.
This beautiful Gem was rephrased by Osho in the 1970′s in more than 90+ discourses.
It is also known as a milestone in the development of human consciousness. The first text in the non-duality.

What will happen if you end up with a false twin in your twin flame journey?,"Twin in twin flame is always false. It is your natural propensity to have a partner. It is part of human nature.
All twin flame experts are not in a better position than you. They are as illusioned as you are, or they are no better than scammers who create a glossy profile on a dating site or matrimonial site.
This is their business and they sell false promises without guarantee.
I have never come across any spiritual master who talks about twin flame. The concept of the twin flame is a scam at a deeper level.
Runner and chaser and everything in between is all mind manipulation.

Is there a journey after enlightenment?,"We enter on a rare pilgrimage after enlightenment. I happened to read ‘The Ten Bulls of Zen' by Kakuan which is something unique in the history of human consciousness. Truth has been expressed in many ways, and it has always been found that it remains unexpressed whatsoever you do. It simply escapes description. The ‘Ten Bulls of Zen' by Kakuan have tried in a single effort to express the inexpressible.

The first eight bulls came from Taoism and two were added by Zen master Kakuan.
These two bulls represent the journey after enlightenment. The eighth bull represents enlightenment.
9th bull says ‘ life is a goal'. Now one knows thoughts, dreams and reality are not different there is no distinction because no-mind can't distinguish.
You understand religion is mean not end. Religion is to make you happy not repressed. Happiness is Advaita - non-dual. Your mind is misery. Life is only happiness. Happiness is climate.
Spread happiness by helping people to come out of mind. You have found new goal.
Tenth Bull:- (returning to society) I go to the market place again with my bottle of wine and return home with my staff (disciples). Why one should follow the footprints of patriarchs?

People need your help to be happy. Now everybody is enlightened for you. Love them equally.
Answer the question:-
What is this life? If death comes and takes it, what is this life? What meaning does it carry if one is so impotent against death?
Remember, after birth everybody is on his deathbed. There is no other way. All beds are deathbeds because after birth only one thing is certain, and that is death.
The search for the enlightenment is the search for a real-life, authentic life, which knows no death.

"If after getting enlightened, do we overcome all of the positive-negative effects of all the planets?","On enlightenment one enters Turiya - The fourth. Turiya is beyond states of the human consciousness. Turiya is not a state it is true nature of our existence that which makes this earth move where all dreams dissolve, where neither God nor devil remains, where neither sorrows nor happiness remains, where neither sleep nor waking remains.
Turiya is God's state.

Osho had said Christianity had spread nearly all over the world because of missionaries’ technique of conversion and not because of the teaching of Jesus Christ. Do you agree?,"Absolutely No,
First time in human history Jesus said, “God is love.”
The message of Jesus and Buddha is the same. But the message of Jesus penetrates deeper because Jesus is the epitome of forgiveness.
I came across many people who can't forgive and lead a very miserable life. Forgiveness sets you free from your past.
Though there is no difference between Krishna, Buddha and Jesus but we project our imagination and always try to find - “What's in it for me?”
Now questioner is interested in knowing the reason for the widespread of Christianity.
What is the point?
Just read what Jesus has to say. Take good things and move on."
How does spirituality help people to remain happy/peaceful?,"Spirituality emphasizes on liberation from any dependency to be happy.
Spirituality teaches you to let go thousand and one things that you value without knowing the nature of affair.
We keep moving from person to person, person to thing and then again things to person. One more girlfriend, one new pair of shoes. It is like moving in circles.
First-time spirituality asks you to search inside there is something bigger about you hidden inside of you and that is your true-self.
Once your search for true-self is started, you start to enjoy the journey and that is where the Joy is.
It is always the journey that we enjoy, not the destination."
Osho had said real spirituality is only for people with a gambler’s attitude. Do you agree?,"Search for enlightenment is indeed a biggest gamble anyone can play because in spirituality one has to die to get new life and it is possible one may actually die or end up in mental asylum.
It is reverse-engineering the nature of existence , it is a fight where there is one fighter - mind , which has to fight with itself.
I have met people moving like zombies for decades. They see all kind of spirits and souls. They walk with them dine with them. It is truly way to insanity.
And there is no guarantee that you will reach enlightenment.
Spirituality is not for timid people it is matter of death and resurrection."
Will the dark night of the soul ever end? Can it go for a whole lifetime?,"Usually, the dark night of the soul doesn't end. I have met people who got stuck at DNTS for more than 25 years. This is last stop of the material world.
This is a tussle between soul and ego. Your ego is pulling your soul back. Your soul wants to be liberated.
Ego is resisting its death or ego is giving DARK NIGHTS to your soul. The soul is being chained and beaten by ego.
This stage is also called the DEATH (death of ego) stage. People in this stage move like a zombie.
Only an enlightened master can help you end DNTS. His mere look can heal wounds of your soul.
The next stage of the spiritual journey is LIFE…
If you remain aware and with the help of the master you will get a new ego, which is more humane. Here master works as womb to give birth to New Life.
The next stage is BLISS if you remain aware you WILL enter BLISS. In this stage, the master can't help. You have to work on yourself on your own. YOU have to travel alone.
The next stage is NIRVANA, where neither you nor the master of any help. This journey can be completed if you have accumulated good karma in past lives.
Now the real problem is, it is hard to find a person who has traveled through all stages - an enlightened master.

Do you believe in God and heaven and hell?,"Everything you mentioned exists for you. You can't survive by denying them. If you deny the existence of God you may become neurotic.
God is a pillar of your existence. You can survive without heaven and hell but not without God, it is impossible.
I have met many atheists, their faces look lifeless. One who denies God is ‘No-No-man'. He starts everything with ‘No'.
But the fact is there is God till you are in your mind and there is no God in no-mind."
"How would u become like a spiritual witch and what are some safe ways to start practicing witchcraft? Im 15 and I’ve had experiences with spirits/ ghosts mainly when I was younger though, and I just wanna learn more about it :)?","There is no ghosts or spirits. You are experiencing the fourth plane of reality where you can create your Gods and devils at will.
If you get stuck in this plane you will spend all your life moving in circles.
But there are higher possibilities for you to attain absolute truth. Don't get stuck at illusions.
The fourth plane of reality is full of ghosts and spirits. It is like Alice in wonderland and Harry Potter."
"Dream experts: why am I unable to turn on lights in my dreams? I’m not scared of the dark. Furthermore, I lose control of my lower body at the same time and I’m unable to walk and have to crawl to each switch, only to find they won’t turn on.","Because your dream is as real as reality. Mystics say when someone reaches the fourth plane of reality then dreams are as good as reality.
In the fourth plane of reality, you can create God and touch it too. This is also a source of great insights. Your consciousness is trying to move out of your body actually, not intellectually.
The day you will be able to switch on the light your subtle body will be able to travel the world and return to your physical body.
This is not a dream this is the reality of your subtle body.

"Buddha took meditation, enlightenment, karma, reincarnation from Upanishads and attained enlightenment and then rejected Vedas. Is not it like you took money from someone to buy a car and after you purchase you reject him? How do you justify this?","“You have to move on. I am only a teacher, not a master. I was pretending and I am very sorry!” said Buddha’s master. Buddha was totally shattered and tired.
He went to take a bath in a nearby river, Niranjana. It is a very small river; in the summer it is not even one foot deep. And he was taking a bath, but he was so weak that he could not cross that small current. He had to hang onto a branch of a tree for a few moments to gather some energy so that he could get out of the river. He felt like cheated in the name of enlightenment.
That experience made it clear to him there is no enlightenment.
Though denying to be real master can only be claimed by the real master, according to me Buddha’s master was real courageous master who declared himself charlatan.
Buddha’s last hook of attachment and of desire to be enlightened disappeared in one stroke.
His enlightenment came out of desirelessness not through knowledge of Vedas.
Enlightenment can happen to anyone who’s seeking has ended.

"Why do we struggle for success in life? Is it because of power, money, or anything? Are these things really necessary in life to get real peace and happiness?","Life is a tabula rasa - a clean slate. It is up to you what meaning you give it. Life is neither in success nor in power and money.
Life is in living its mystery.
If your happiness depends on other persons or things you will never be permanently happy.
Real peace can be attained if you seek your true-self or true meaning. Those who start to enjoy search are entitled to find peace.
The day you ask - “Who am I?”
The journey of your soul starts."
"Do self-realized sages who have attained the Turiya, ever experience the waking, dream and deep sleep states?","Turiya is beyond states of the human consciousness. Turiya is not a state it is true nature of our existence that which makes this earth move where all dreams dissolve, where neither God nor devil remains, where neither sorrows nor happiness remains, where neither sleep nor waking remains.
Turiya is God's state.

I am 37 and I am an orphan. I have no home and no work. I’m looking for an ashram where I can live a lifetime free. Can I stay in the ashram forever?,"Now this is escapism.

There is nothing free in this world. You will have to transact you self-esteem for free breakfasts and lunches.

Is the ego the opposite of the soul?,"The ego is shell of the soul in this birth. Because without a soul you can't be alive.
Your eternal being is the soul which is never born or die, which can't be created or destroyed.
Ego is your identity in this birth., which you acquire by karma. Karma of every birth is accumulated and you take that with you in your next birth.
The cycle of life and death continues till you attain Nirvana."
What question do you personally find the most enlightening?,"All questions are enlightening till you aren't awake and all answers are useless till you are asleep.
The questioning mind is always restless. The very nature of mind is to confirm the answers hidden inside of you.
The mind always looks out for confirmation, not observation.
Before you question you need to learn to have an open mind and keen eye.
‘Keen eye’ is optional but ‘open mind’ is not."
"I have stomach problems, when medicines didn't work that much. I started believing in God and nowadays feel much relaxed than before but not fully cured. I am slowly leaning towards spirituality. Why does this happening in my life?","When you surrender to God then the fear of the unknown is eliminated. The fear of the unknown stems from the fear of death.
When you surrender to God and start trusting his decisions then inner alchemy happens.
With every morning you start to synchronise with divine.
Your leaning towards spirituality is call of the God."
"Which of our organs is the seat of our conscious awareness and intelligence, the heart or the brain?","The seat of consciousness is Third Eye - Ajna Chakra or Agya Chakra. Agya (order) chakra orders our focus.
This is also seat of our God or loved one. That is why when we fall in love we forget God and lover becomes god.
Tujhe Mein Rab Dikhta hai, Yaara Mein Kya Karion.
Heart is center of our intuition. Heart always anticipates unknown and that is why it beats fast when something unknown, unexpected happens."
Do you think that if a person who doesn't care about spirituality or being spiritual can be genuinely happy and content with their life?,"Happiness is bogus if the Buddhahood is not attained.
Then life is artificial like we keep moving from person to person, person to thing and then again things to a person.
Google search of “Elizabeth Taylor marriages list” retrieved:-
She was married eight times to seven men, converted to Judaism, endured several serious illnesses, and led a jet-set lifestyle, including assembling one of the most expensive private collections of jewellery in the world. After many years of ill health, Taylor died from congestive heart failure in 2011, at the age of 79.
You can find a thousand and one things to do that is how we have:-
100 places to visit before you die
100 recipes to try before you die
100 poses to try in bed - that is too much

Life is in stillness, silence and one who reaches home doesn't need anybody or anything to be happy.

Sometimes I just zone out and sit staring into space not really thinking about anything but I feel calm. Is that the same as meditating?,"Yes, it is meditation but I must tell you that you are a true soul that is why it has come to you so easily.

The question ends at the conclusion you are a very intelligent person."

Why was UG Krishnamurti so critical to Jiddu Krishnamurti and Osho? How come any thoughtful person being so critical about anyone in world.,"All spiritual masters are conmen. They know people are confused. They know people are directionless, people need a map to have a purposeful life. People want a ready-made solution out of the box.
All holy scriptures are nothing more than maps. You can choose any map it will lead you nowhere. Religions are prisons. How does it matter prison is of iron or gold?
Real alchemy happens when one begins to seek himself. How does it matter what Osho, Jiddu, UG said? It is also not more than jail till you reach home.

Can Buddhism cure diffucilt to treat illnesses?,"Absolutely yes, if the illness is related to neurosis or our nervous system.
Buddhism can cure most of the illness if you follow them from the heart.
Let's talk energies.
There is only one energy we have but there are many manifestations. The same energy can become love or hatred, doubt or trust, gratitude or ego, G-O-D or D-O-G.
Now our all energy is wasted in desires and attachments. If you just become desireless and forego attachments the same energy will start healing your nervous system.
You will start moving from medication to meditation. You will recover quickly.
The purpose of Religion is to cure you.
"
How do I get into deeper states of meditation?,"The only quick fix to go deeper into meditation is to meditate with an enlightened being.
What you will accomplish in years or decades can happen in a few weeks or maybe in a few hours. The mere presence of an enlightened being will give you taste of silence.
If you feel you are stuck somewhere then most probably you are facing ‘dark night of the soul' and your energy is blocked at the heart chakra.
Symptoms:-
• Being overly defensive • Feeling closed down • Jealousy; fear of intimacy • Codependency, relying on other’s approval and attention • Trying to please at all cost • Always putting oneself in the role of the savior or the rescuer; or on the contrary, falling into victimization • Excessive isolation, being reclusive and antisocial • Holding grudges, not being able to forgive.
At the physical level, it can manifest as: • Respiratory ailments, such as lung infection and bronchitis. • Circulatory and heart-related issues. When the energy in your fourth chakra is blocked or hindered, you may experience what is sometimes referred to as heart chakra pain

"My friend started Vipassana Sadhana at home, but discontinued after experiencing negative emotions after a week. Should he restart, stop, or seek professional guidance?","Negative emotions arise when meditation goes deeper. This is the first thing that happens when your awareness touches the unconscious mind where all the repressed emotions and memories are stored.

To heal all the wounds they need to be uncovered first so it is a good sign that he experienced the negative emotions.
If he keeps meditating then he will transcend those negative emotions and new dawn will begin.
So, in the long term, Vipassana meditation should not be bad for you, but yes, in the short term, it can make you feel bad.

"Why does one's mind feel connected to something for eg., some prefer Advaita Vedanta philosophy, some prefer mindfulness and so on and so forth or else someone feels connected to music of Beethoven and some feel connected to modern? Why is that?","Mind is always restless it starts with newness and ends with boredom on every subject or topic.
Nobody can remain interested in the same thing all his life even if someone pursues a passion all his life, he is still after newness in one or another form.
e.g. If someone is musician he is after newer tunes and technology in music.
One who comes to understand the real life is in boredom not in preferences or interests, that is he who starts seeking for his true-self.
Music is not in the words of the songs, real music is in gap between the words, between the notes.
Real alchemy happens in boredom not in pursuing a passion.

"What did Nisargadatta Maharaj mean when he said, ""The clearer you understand that on the level of the mind you can be described in negative terms only, the quicker you will come to the end of your search and realize your limitless being.""?","This very statement means the end of the search doesn't belong to mind.
The end of the search belongs to no-mind when you negate everything in your mind you reach emptiness.
Emptiness is not negative it is full of beyondness, being limitless.
It doesn't matter how beautifully one strings words it is always a matter of experiencing.
Experience of being empty of all words and language.

Do you feel that the Twin Flame theory is a current trend in relationship styles?,"Your question is relevant and using ‘Twin Flame Theory' in your question makes it more compelling for me to answer.
A twin flame is a misuse of the fourth plane of our reality where one can even create God and can touch it too. But if one doesn't fall into unconsciousness (Twin flame is falling unconscious) one can transcend duality and become blissful permanently.
A twin flame is a trap where one goes unconscious and start moving in circles. 99 out of 100 are just dreaming and just mirroring their imagination. Because the fourth plane of reality is the last stop of duality. The very word ‘Twin' is a representation of duality.
Ask any spiritual teacher he will say duality is the cause of our sorrows.

Is it worth finding your twin flame?
I don't think so because happiness should not depend on others. Happiness should come from within. When you can be ocean and sky, why should you try to be a water well?

Is there any link between Awakening to Being and intelligence? I have read many who say ‘no’ but then most who write about Awakening come across as very intelligent. This may only be due to good writers having a certain level of intellect.,"To get the answer to your question I shall have to reverse the question and that will be the answer.
There is a link between Awakening to being and intelligence. Many say ‘no’ but then most who write about Awakening we come across as very intelligent. This may only be due to awakening happens to those who attain a certain level of intellect.
If awakening happens to dumbhead he will have a sudden upsurge in intellect because all confusion is swiped away by the awakening he will suddenly turn into a good singer, poet or writer. In either form of communication, he would like to express himself.
There are many illiterates like Kabir, Paltu, Ramana Maharishi, Wazid who expressed themselves in different ways after awakening.

"Considering that science has now proven that your thoughts tremendously impact your health, can we heal ourselves through thought, meditation, hypnosis, placebo, etc.?","Healing through thoughts happens by replacing negative thoughts with positive thoughts.
Meditation prepares you to live in the present and that is what humans lack.
Look at animals and birds they don't meditate because they live in present.
All diseases are because we over analyse and over think without the valid reason.
Hypnosis is a great tool to bring out the repressions and if it can be clubbed with meditation then all the mental problems will be solved."
Can you break open your third eye with a long wand up your nose?,"In Tibet Lamas do open the third eye by operating but not with a long wand up the nose.
They drill a very thin hole right between the eyes through the skull and then the person is kept in a dark room for three weeks exposing him to light little by little.

There is a problem with that because if the third eye is opened by an operation then there is no upgrade in consciousness. So it carries the risk of getting mad as the third eye is intuitive this can spill the consciousness away from the body making it impossible for the person to remain in body.
This can cause neurosis.

"How can I experience one-ness with God? Should I practice Sambhavi Mahamudra? If not, what else?","Sambhavi Mahamudra?????
This very name defies God. This very name pushes God away from you. The very idea of doing something is of worldly. God is where doing ceases and you become a witness. God is when you are not.
God is an experience of your true-self. God is not Adiyogi. God is life energy, the day you return to the source you will experience God."
Why do I feel so dizzy or spinning head feeling on the fourth day or day of Vipassana initiation? It has continued even after completing ten days. What is happening here?,"The energy of your body is being accumulated in your head. You are not meditating properly or you failed to understand Vipassana.
You are not following your breathing, you are controlling your breathing. Check it out with your master.
Energy should be pushed to lower centres like heart and navel but you are always in your head so energy is getting denser in your head."
Is Sadhguru a self-realized master of an enlightened master? I'm asking because I can see lately he's massively lacking awareness of the present moment. Everyone can see this by simply looking in his eyes and compare them with Osho's eyes.,"Enlightened beings are humans only and if enlightened being decides to be worldly then he is bound to behave like a worldly.You can't play tennis on the football ground.
This is the reason Buddha decided to spend his life as a beggar. He remained with his begging bowl for the rest of his life.
As Buddha said - Life is suffering and there is the reason for it, the reason is desires and attachments, once you become desireless, you become blissful.
Don't doubt his enlightenment, doubt his intentions. Enlightenment doesn't mean morality.
Don't mix apples with oranges. Osho is the rarest of rare case. Osho never compromised the truth. Osho spoke from his experience. Jaggi speaks according to your experience. He lacks versatility. That is why his work is not coherent.
Osho used to blink his eyes rarely because blinking of eyes depicts the state of inner being and it changes when one is being calculated. Osho was never calculative. What is what is."
"I think spirituality is a realistic pursuit for the rich, just as Osho said, while the poor/middle-class/lazy use it as an excuse actually need to cover their immediate needs but tend to find great excuses in spirituality. Is this true?","The path of Buddha goes through epicurean. Boredom is the only reason one starts to search the meaning on the path of spirituality.
I don't think Buddha started his search because of sorrows, he started his search because of boredom.
Your very boredom from materialistic things will ignite the search for meaning and then you will become spiritual out of understanding.
Go and enjoy every aspect of life and every luxury of life. That will give your life depth and out of that depth, your spiritual awakening will have depth.
If everybody becomes Buddha then what will be the value of Buddha. You need to explore a broader spectrum of life let your being feel bored and then you will have no longing for materialistic things.
All who became enlightened were from Royal families - Buddha, Mahavira, Janak and Meera. It is very difficult for the poor to be spiritual because he is always calculating the working hours and he remains in struggle to make the both ends meet."
"If you imagined two frequencies of sound in your mind while listening to another one in the real world. According to wave particle duality, brain is a system of waves, what effect would this have on the universe and on your brain? Butterfly effect?","This is impossible to have two thoughts at a time because the mind is single-tasking. Even if you listen to two frequencies from outside it remains a resultant of two frequencies as one.
The brain is a system of emitting waves but no one can consciously control the waves by manipulating the thoughts and visualisation."
Can an enlightened person heal someone's chakra just by a touch?,"Mere presence of enlightened being heals and touch can show you God.
The flow of prana (life energy) can heal all seven chakras and there are instances when enlightened being can also revive the dead body.
The medium (healer) has to be egoless and he should not be after money or sex."
"Can we help spiritually heal those who aren’t opened to healing? It’s hard watching loved ones on a low vibration. If so, how do we open their hearts?","There is always a window in the closed wall, to heal someone healer should be able to sense the open window in the sufferer.
If the healer is experienced he can transfer the spiritual energy at the right moment. Healing happens in a split-second.

Let me clear the concept of low and high vibrations. Only low vibrations can heal the person like Delta Vibration (<4 Cycle Per Second), high vibrations cause anxiety like Beta and Gamma vibrations.
There is no need to open their heart before healing, instead, healing will open their heart.

Is it credible when people are hypnotized to go to past lives? Are they just dreams or is there proof of people reincarnating?,"
Past life regression is a technique to uncover the DNA programming of many generations.
There are a lot of memories of our ancestors stored in our DNA and they can be retrieved and unburdened by simply being aware of them.
Awareness of something sets you free of it, this is the beauty of our universe because awareness is the fabric of our universe.
Now if the concern of the questioner is existence of past lives the answer is “No”. There are no past lives (but when you go under past life regression it feels damn real) and in that series, it also defies your God.
God is also imagination, but if you believe in God then you will have to believe in past lives also otherwise you will split and you will become plastic.
Don't be selective you will become fragmented and phoney. Either accept all or nothing to have a balanced life. Past lives hold the key to your future and that is what you should be interested in.

Does a soul react to logical decisions made by us?,"The soul doesn't interfere with logic of mind.
Soul is pure it does get affected by our karma as it feeds back our body and mind with sense of good or bad.
If you don't accept your darkness it simply disconnects and that is how criminals are born.
Spirituality is transformational quest of finding your soul. Once you connect with your soul life becomes divine.
Krishna, Jesus and Buddha are examples of the possibility a man carries.
You too can be divine.
As mystics say, “ We all are divine having human experience.”"
"According to Hinduism, there are 3 types of karma. What are they, and why?","
Krishna uses three words: karma, akarma and vikarma, meaning action, inaction and non-action.
What is the action?
According to Krishna, the action is that which you do as a doer, as an ego. A doing with a doer, in which one thinks of himself as a doer, is action. As long as ‘I' remain a doer, whatever ‘I’ do is action.
Inaction is just the opposite kind of action; it is action without a doer. Inaction does not mean the absence of action, but it certainly means the absence of the doer. An egoless action is an inaction. If the centre, the ego, the I, the doer, ceases and the only action remains, it is inaction. Action without a doer is inaction.
What does Krishna mean by non-action? Where there is neither a doer nor a doing, yet things happen, there is non-action. For example, we breathe, which we are not required to do by our effort. There is neither a doer nor a doing so far as acts like breathing are concerned. Similarly, the blood circulates through the body, the food is digested, and the heart beats.
How can you categorize such an act?
They come in the category of non-action, which means action happening without a doer and without doing.

What do you get in exchange of selling a soul?,"Joker is born and your soul is raped by devil every night I don't know which drink the devil loves but I am pretty sure it must be an alcoholic drink.
He must be liking extra-large peg and how many? May be around 9 extra-large pegs.
Then your soul must be praying that devil should drink little more than one bottle so that devil falls down unconscious.
But again morning is going to be cruel for your soul because in a hangover one lasts little longer.
Looking at the situation I would suggest you - Deal is not worth it.
You better save your soul.
"
Why do many spiritual seekers go insane? What is the main cause behind it?,"Spirituality is the path of paradoxes. Only paradoxes can give space of strangeness and strangeness is what shakes you - gives you ‘dark night of the soul'.
Anything that gives you peace is giving you a false belief system.
For example, almost everybody believes there is God. Now God is the reason for your duality and till you start to doubt the existence of God your third eye will not open.
That is the reason the opening of the third eye is so rare. But once you dare to kill God your sixth chakra (third eye) will open. Opening of third eye releases all the overload on your body and brain.Your body becomes weightless.
Enlightenment is the start of a new journey and before enlightenment, everything is a mess.
Before enlightenment, this world is a madhouse where people live unconsciously and what else can you expect from the person who is going through the ‘dark night of the soul'. He is on the verge of going insane or mad.

Was Shiva real and if so at what vibration was he? Was he in human form and did he start the spiritual process on this planet?,"Shiva is at vibration below 2 CPS (cycle per second).
The question is subjective because there are many instances when he is felt and seen even now.
And
He comes, surely he comes. Whenever Kundalini is awakened to the seventh chakra he visits, I am witness I have seen him.

Ravana was a well-learned person and the greatest devotee of Shiva, in many places he is treated as God.

Kundalini of Ravana was awakened and when kundalini is awakened Shiva comes to bless even today.
Lord Shiva came and gave him the celestial nectar of immortality."
"What's the difference between ""soul"" and ""spirit""?","Spirit is something of mood and ambition. Spirit runs high when you want something like you to want to make love then the spirit is high.
The soul is never high or low it respects your nature but also keeps telling you that you are not your name, your are not your position, you are not your bank balance, you are not even your kids.
Your soul can't be created or destroyed no matter what you become.

Is someday possessed is true? Or there are only mental imbalance caused genetic or social or any other forms,"A possessed person is believed to be possessed by a spirit, demon, or other entity, which controls a person's actions.
The possessed person claims symptoms of demonic possession including missing memories, perceptual distortions and loss of a sense of control.
These are mental imbalances caused by blocked energies in the body and this blockage is caused by many factors related to past lives OR DNA.
There is deep social and religious conditioning that also contribute to these imbalances.
All in all, there is no demonic possession it is all that seems so, but not true."
What would happen if Superman reached enlightenment? Why has he not?,"‘superman' can never attain enlightenment. The questioner also can't reach enlightenment. He is seeking powers in enlightenment. Powers are not attributes of enlightenment.
The very word ‘superman' is a disqualification. What you seek in the real world ‘superman'. It is a shadow of your stupidity.
If ‘superman' even thinks of enlightenment then this is the only moment when Buddha will cry and Krishna will have uproarious laugh.
I am laughing too."
"In spirituality there is a term 'Enlightened', does the opposite of this term also exist? And, is it possible for a person who once was enlightened to get back to his normal state without knowing, known to be 'Enlightened'?","Enlightenment has no opposite to it. Unenlightenment is not the opposite of enlightenment; it is only the absence of enlightenment.
It is just like darkness is the absence of light. Darkness doesn't have the existence of its own.
There is nothing like ‘De-Enlightened'. Enlightenment is the point of no return. The process of Enlightenment is strenuous and cumbersome and it is the transformation of human physiology and psychology.
The energy which follows downwards starts to follow upwards towards the moon. Body energy defies gravity- the law of nature.
There is a whole set of rewiring of the brain and it is impossible to restore the original settings of the brain.
There is no reverse gear. Once enlightened, always enlightened."
What is the opposite of enlightenment?,"Enlightenment has no opposite to it. Unenlightenment is not the opposite of enlightenment; it is only the absence of enlightenment.
It is just like darkness is the absence of light. Darkness has no existence of its own."
Can we see energy itself?,"In most of the religions, sacred persons may be depicted with a halo in the form of a circular glow around the head or around the whole body—this is often called a mandorla.

Now, this is the energy field around the head of an enlightened being.
When Buddha became enlightened he was crossing the road one man was taken aback by the glow around the head of Buddha and asked,
Are you God?
Buddha said, “No”.
Are you some celestial being?
Buddha said, “No”.
What are you?
Buddha said, “ I am awake.”
Energy can be seen as an aura of the person and every person carries the energy field and few can even categorize the person's state of mind by looking at the colour of the aura.
More easily energy can be felt but few can actually see it and manipulate it.

Is it okay that a person enjoys materialistic things while walking on a spiritual path?,"The path of Buddha goes through epicurean. Boredom is the only reason one starts to search the meaning on the path of spirituality.
I don't think Buddha started his search because of sorrows, he started his search because of boredom.
Your very boredom from materialistic things will ignite the search for meaning and then you will become spiritual out of understanding.
Go and enjoy every aspect of life and every luxury of life. That will give your life depth and out of that depth, your spiritual awakening will have depth.
If everybody becomes Buddha then what will be the value of Buddha. You need to explore a broader spectrum of life let your being feel bored and then you will have no longing for materialistic things.
All who became enlightened were from Royal families - Buddha, Mahavira, Janak and Meera. It is very difficult for the poor to be spiritual because he is always calculating the working hours and he remains in struggle to make the both ends meet.
Only Zorba can be Buddha."
Twin Flames and Shiva-Shakti. What is the connection? Especially interested in answers from India or Hindu friends anywhere.,"Shiv-Shakti is a concept which relates to ‘twin flame' up to heart chakra. ‘Twin flame' has a root in tantra but with a Cap.
Twinflame is the new label given to tantric phenomena where a virgin female becomes a device to attain a higher level of consciousness.
Tantra mentions soul mates and soul mates are two persons having kundalini ascension.
But the problem with ‘twin flame' is that it can awaken kundalini up to heart chakra and the possibility of higher consciousness is halted at the heart chakra.
Above heart chakra, there is non-duality and spirituality starts at the fifth chakra. Humans have Religions because of our speech and language and the fifth chakra is responsible for that.
At heart chakra, one can live a balanced life but it will always be full of imaginations and ‘twin flame' is the result of that possibility of the fourth chakra (body).
‘Twin flame' is helpful to start the spiritual journey but there is a strong possibility that one may get stuck at it and deny higher possibilities.
‘Twin flame' can be induced in any couple if they meditate and awaken the kundalini up to the heart chakra."
"Who invented the ""twinflame"" phenomenon? Why do many people think that their toxic partners act the way they act because this is how twinflame is? Who can give the proof they are following illusions? Thanks","Twinflame is the new label given to tantric phenomena where a virgin female becomes a device to attain a higher level of consciousness.

"How do you believe someone else on this rare path to spirituality, when you don't have faith even on yourself? Are there any checks on who to believe when this field is full of frauds?","Spirituality is the path of paradoxes. Only paradoxes can give space of strangeness and strangeness is what shakes you - gives you ‘dark night of the soul'.
Anything that gives you peace is giving you a false belief system.
For example, almost everybody believes there is God. Now God is the reason for your duality and till you start to doubt the existence of God your third eye will not open.
That is the reason the opening of the third eye is so rare. But once you dare to kill God your sixth chakra (third eye) will open. Opening of third eye releases all the overload on your body and brain.Your body becomes weightless.
When you start to learn walking you fall thousands of time but stand up and try till you make it. If you give up and don't learn to walk will you be able to survive? In any case, you have to learn to walk because it is a question of survival likewise if your spiritual quest is started you have to finish it because this is also the question of survival and you are fortunate that you question - “Who am I?”
Remember there is no wrong or right on the path of finding your truth. Anything that takes you to absolute truth is right. It is very difficult to come to the right door, doors have to be knocked on. One has to wander into the wrong market in search of the right. Also, this is an essential stage of discovery. When you search, you will find that those who were wrong also gave support. Even identifying the wrong as wrong becomes a step to identify the right as the right."
Why do you think you’re enlightened?,"Enlightenment is not something one can miss I am not talking about one who is enlightened I am talking about people around him.
Even animals and birds can't miss it let alone the humans. Enlightenment means something of sky walking on earth.
When kundalini hits the third eye and seventh chakra then nothing remains the same I know many enlightened people.
It is not only me there are many around the world.
It is rare but many share experiences of spiritual awakening.
Why I say I am enlightened you will know in the next 5 years."
"After meditation, I feel heavyness at the centre of my eyes like someone hammering from inside. What is the meaning of this?","I guess there is something wrong with your meditation.
How do you meditate?
I think you are doing concentration or contemplation.
Both of these activities exaggerate the anxiety.
Remember it takes time for the mind to learn silence.
Silence is not the nature of the mind. Restlessness is the very nature of the mind. Confusion is the way of mind. The mind exists because of confusion, and confusion causes anxiety.
Try this:-
Wake up early in the morning and walk out to some park before sunrise and have a brisk walk for 3–4 miles.
Then sit comfortably, close your eyes and listen to the chirping of birds, feel the wind on your face.
That is called witnessing. Meditation is neither concentration nor contemplation.
Meditation is witnessing."
Is there a detrimental side to mindfulness?,"At its best, mindfulness keeps you in the present moment. It helps you calm your body and would calm your nagging internal voice, and you remain to present moments of life feeling energized and invigorated.
Far too often, rather than relaxing, it would begin to accelerate your heartbeats as your inner monologue would take a nasty turn, as unpleasant memories and feelings of failure and hopelessness flooding your mind. These events might become so frequent that you would like to relax into dreaming mode.
Mindfulness might cause heightened activity in the insular cortex which results in the loudness in the intensity of all your emotions. Eventually, your sensitivity to every slight change could become overwhelming causing full-on panic attacks.
On the other end, people experience this sense of numbness like saying, ‘I can't feel anything, I don't feel any love for my family.’
These are extreme cases of the mindfulness.
Mindfulness at its worst can cause sleep disorder also.
Psychologists say people sleep not because they want to sleep, they sleep because humans love dreaming. Nobody sleeps full 8–10 hrs, it is swinging between dreaming and deep sleep.
We don’t enjoy sleep, because in deep sleep we remain unconscious.
We tend to enjoy dreams much like a story.
Mindfulness has benefits to an extent and beyond that, it becomes a painful monologue."
Does wearing a red and black combination have any bad effect on us? Does it block chakras? What are good colour combinations for chakra?,"Wearing a particular colour doesn't affect chakras.
Chakras are affected by your breathing, thoughts and emotions.
Pranayama is a breathing discipline that stirs Chakras.
Positive thoughts allow energy to follow smoothly through chakras.
Positive emotions balance the energy in your chakras.
Eating non-veg will block your heart chakra.
Don't be confused by the colours you wear and the colours of the chakras."
Why are people who are in the dark night of the soul phase after kundalini awakening (Vishnu granthi / blocked heart chakra) so tired? What happens to their energy? I need a lot of sleep every day and sometimes feel like a zombie.,"After the stirring of kundalini and blockage at the heart chakra, the conscious mind (ego) resists its absence.
It is like your soul is trying to run and your mind(ego) is cringing that is what causes wear and tear of energy. Death of ego is psychological death and this is the same that happens in physical death but in that our body also dies so there is no one remains to report back.
But the death of the ego is a far greater event because it is samadhi where nothing remains the same, not even our sensory system.
And when no-mind is attained it feels like a burden of many lives has been lifted from you and trust me it feels like floating in the air like a butterfly.
Let's understand the overload that is what you are going through. It does feel like a winding long road and that is what exhausts the ego (conscious mind) and when you attain no-mind it feels like emptying the vessel and energy starts to flow upwards towards the moon. You will be able to feel the energy going upwards on full moon night.
If the earth is worldly then the moon is spiritual that is why the moon has so much significance in tantra.
It is a matter of changing the natural laws of nature it is like moving from sunboy to moonboy. This is the point of no return also.
Changing whole physiology doesn't even come under medical science and even science has failed to explain it but this is where the adventure exists.
Don't think it is normal phenomena it is the most mysterious and work of many lives."
"If the soul exists before life and continues after, what is the point of living?","The soul is your true self and no doubt it is recycled but as Krishna said even God has to perform Karma.
The only thing you are missing the very element of your existence - help people to live a joyful life.
Why are you getting selfish, be generous and let life flow inside of you.
Suicide is not the solution you need to know your existence is the most blissful thing that happened to this universe.
Your ‘isness' is all that matters."
How many hours of focusing on energy flow would it take to attain a Kundalini awakening?,"Awakening of kundalini means first stirring of prana.
It is a subjective question and any direct answer will be misleading.
Let me try:-
Awakening of kundalini has very little to do with meditation or concentration.
Awakening of kundalini is a matter of breathing consciously and space of strangeness in life. Anything that will break the unconscious patterns in your life will stir the kundalini.
Usually, kundalini is awakened in near-death experiences, something that stirs your soul like divorce, death of loved one.
Nobody can awaken kundalini by meditation alone it requires deep inner work."
"I feel like I am less conscious, People around me complain I react on things late, I can't quickly understand the situation or people around me, I feel unknown fear, my movements (walking, Speaking etc) are slow, how to resolve these problems?","There is something bad has happened to you and your self-esteem is damaged to the very core.
Someone might have spit on your soul. It took your trust away from you. Now you are full of doubts only.
Doubts and only doubts are creating this situation but there is a way to resolve it.
Surrender to God, let him decide and follow his will. If you surrender to God's will your life will become prayer.
Trust God that he will do what is right for you. Your trust will give you the courage to love life and everybody around you.
Only surrender and trust can make your being joyful regardless of the situation."
How simply is doing yoga or pranayam dangerous without proper knowledge of Kundalini awakening?,"Mind and breath are interconnected. A change in breathing affects a corresponding change in state of mind. For instance, it is impossible for a man to be angry if he keeps his breathing steady and calm.
Breathing is the bridge between body and soul. Anything you do to breathing will stir your kundalini.
All yoga Guru actually harm people by not issuing warning about the kundalini dangers.
If you want to live peaceful life never ever muddle with breathing it can create havoc in your mental balance.
Maharishi Pitanjali in his text of Yoga Sutra has mentioned dangers of Pranayama or any change in discipline of breathing.
If the person is not very intelligent then pranayama will not harm but if Sadhak is intelligent and a seeker then Pranayam will be the first step to stir kundalini."
"When you are on your way to enlightenment, how do you view the world? What happens to the worries? Once you are enlightened, do you feel a sense of responsibility for the betterment of the world?","Enlightenment is the start of a new journey and before enlightenment, everything is a mess.
Before enlightenment, this world is a madhouse where people live unconsciously and what else can you expect from the person who is going through the ‘dark night of the soul'. He is on the verge of going mad.
Now to the last part of the question - enlightenment is the message of the divine to help those who are walking the same path of Enlightenment.
If an enlightened being doesn't help people to live a life of joy then he won't find peace, he is as good as mad like he was before.
As always said - with great power comes great responsibility."
How do you overcome fear?,"One of the traits one acquires on enlightenment is the ability to understand fear.
Fear can never be overcome but the moment you understand fear it will be no more.
Fear is part of our defence system of fight or flight response and it is built into every living being.
All fears can be attributed to fear of death and once you understand death you will not have fear.
Death is inevitable and death is something that happens every day because what we know as b'day is actually one more year subtracted from your life.
Those who understand death can live life fully because death is the door to yet another unknown life adventure."
How do you remove Syskey?,"The wall around your heart is of doubts and unforgiveness.
Once you start to understand Jesus then the wall will fall down automatically.
One of the most precious lesson I learnt from Jesus that forgiveness is the only virtue that sets you free of all baggage.
Forgive everybody and specifically yourself.
Forgiveness and trust are the only resolutions that make your heart grow into love and compassion.
If forgiveness can liberate Jesus then we are just a part of Jesus.
Forgiveness will surely liberate us also.
And the magic is that it takes a few seconds to understand the message of Jesus.
Just close your eyes, feel your heart…….and Booommm……"
"What happens in chakra healing, and how is it done? What does a person do in Chakra healing?","If there is an imbalance in the chakra or more specifically imbalance in kundalini then it can be healed immediately by transferring kundalini energy by the medium.
Medium is a generally enlightened male who can withdraw and control the kundalini energy from universal KUNDA.
Medium is required to be egoless and the seeker or the patient has to be totally in surrender mode and then the rapport is built and just by touching the third eye the kundalini energy is transferred to the Sushumna Nadi and any blockage in the chakras is unblocked in few minutes.
This works like an electric shock and the person may go blank for a few seconds or fall unconscious."
"In spirituality, many people talk about awareness, but how can one discover awareness and understand it directly?","Anything that will define or try to explain awareness aka pure consciousness will fail.
That is something that can't be expressed in words. Words and language fall into dimensions of mind and awareness is going beyond the mind.
Awareness doesn't have a subject as ‘I,’ and object as ‘you'.
How can you discover awareness?
Witnessing as meditation is the only thing man knows which is beyond the mind.
Just witness your thoughts there will be gaps between thoughts that is where you experience awareness for milliseconds and that is where meditation happens.
When you keep meditating by witnessing for years the one fine day one of the gaps become permanent and you enter a state of no-mind.
That is when you experience your pure consciousness aka awareness in the state of no-mind."
"Can I just listen to subliminals before sleep/while meditating, or is it necessary to listen to it while sleeping?","If you are listening to alpha subliminal then it is for meditation.
If you are listening to Theta subliminal then it is for astral travel a deeper meditation.
If you are listening to Delta subliminal then it is for sleeping.
If you are very sleepy then it doesn't matter what you play."
"I heard that when the third eye chakra opens suddenly, we start having wrong feelings that we take for intuition. Is that right?","Absolutely right.
When the third eye opens and kundalini goes dormant then consciousness shifts between no-mind to mind back and forth.
Sometimes consciousness gets stuck in no-mind and you fail to retrieve information from your memory then due to an unknown gap your heart starts beating faster may be up to 160–170 BPM.
Then this causes the strange feeling of fear.
It feels like going blank without the memory of the past."
What are the karmic repercussions for someone who claims to be spiritually enlightened and spreads inaccurate information for personal gain?,"Existentially enlightened being can't go against God's will. Enlightenment means the mergence of the human into God.
Enlightened being can only help people to live better lives.
Spreading wrong information, doing wrong are part of humans not of an enlightened being.
If someone is doing wrong he is doing it as an individual, not as an enlightened being, not as part of God.
He still has to make sure is he really enlightened?
For example, I would like to mention the case of Osho:-
If you read about the last days of Osho you will know it is very costly if an enlightened being spreads wrong information for personal gains (nobody can prove it). Though I think enlightened being falls in the human dimensions only, but the changes in psychology and physiology do not allow enlightened being to live a fake life."
"During mindfulness meditation brain images, can you like travel to places during a meditation state? What meditation lets you travel places like lucid dreaming?","Meditation has little to do with lucid dreaming or astral travel but yes regular meditation practice can help you reach the fourth body which is capable of doing all fantastic deeds like astral travel.
Astral travel happens on the fourth plane of your consciousness. On the fourth plane, your consciousness can jump out of your body and can travel to other places but it requires regular meditation practice where your brain can attain the theta state of mind.
Astral travel is one of the form of lucid dreaming but it is as good as reality. At different level of planes our reality changes and that is how we come to know various manifestation real or imagined."
"What is the consciousness level, and how many levels are there?","There are seven centres of consciousness we know as chakras. One can live a whole life at any of one.
The first three chakras are known as survival essential. These three are common in reptiles, mammals and humans. These are related to basic survival needs - 1st chakra - life:- food, shelter and procreate; second chakra - death:- fight and flight response in case of danger; 3rd chakra:- it is your mind's ‘I' or ego.
4th chakra:- Heart Chakra:- it exists in mammals and it is the reason for love and compassion which is missing in reptiles.
From here upwards there are 3 more chakras which are found in humans only in an extremely developed state.
5th chakra is spiritual chakra; All religions exist because of 5th chakra because it gives us the ability to understand and speak the language.
6th chakra is the third eye which is the cause of our duality and it gives us logic and the ability to choose.
7th chakra is Nirvanic chakra which is the source of pure consciousness aka awareness. Awareness is the fabric of our universe. Awareness is the purest driving force of energy in the universe.
You can live your life at any level of consciousness but as Upanishads say if you reach the 7th level of consciousness then you break the cycle of birth and death because once you become clean of all human traits you attain moksha.
You merge into existence as pure energy from where no reincarnation is possible.
In nutshell, there are seven levels of consciousness and the last one is pure consciousness where the subject ‘I' and object ‘you dissolve and your consciousness becomes awareness."
How do I know whether any form of appearance of Srila Prabhupada in a dream is really him appearing or just my thoughts about him?,"Thoughts are converted into dreams. Dreams appear either because of longings or body needs like thirst or hunger.
Longings include persons or attachments like possessions or relations.
Body is thirty you will dream of water.
It is arrangement of the brain to help your sleep to continue.
There is nothing else all dreams have origins inside of your experience in form of imaginations.
It is your spiritual longing that is creating dreams.
Your brain creates your reality then of course dreams are also created by brain."
How does a person with dissociative identity disorder gain a sense of self-awareness? How does this influence their sense of authentic/true identity?,"Dissociative identity disorder is a very rare condition where a person has more than one or two identities.
There is no cure for this in medical science.
Following is an explanation from the mysticism point of view.
Disclaimer:- Strictly not a medical advice.
This is the condition that can be solved with the help of past life regression.
Brian Weiss has done a lot of work in this field.
There are said to be many memories that we inherit from our past lives and we also carry many memories from the past of loved ones.
What we are today is not what we are in this life we are the sum total of our past lives.
The solution to this is cumbersome but possible beyond the dimensions of medical knowledge.
Miracles do happen."
What are the best ways to find guru in your life?,"The one who seeks finds. Master appears if he is sought. Those who sit do not find him. Those who go on the quest are sure to find a master.
And remember, it is very difficult to come to the right door, doors have to be knocked on. One has to wander into the wrong market in search of the right. Also, this is an essential stage of discovery. When you search, you will find that those who were wrong also gave support. Even identifying the wrong as wrong becomes a step to identify the right as the right.
The moment your eyes meet the eyes of the right master there will be no delay. There is no need of words just eyes meet eyes and your soul is illuminated. There is no need to force things. It will be the joy of freefall.
Meeting of the master is like love at first sight. A sudden clash of thunders. Like meeting your lost lover. This is pure love and all love bring you into this world; This love leads you beyond this world. This is the culmination of love. And all the love eventually brings you down to your body; This love takes you beyond the body. And all love is gross; This love is subtle.
The day you find master, your all questions start dissolving and utter silence surrounds you. You become one with the master.
You enter the world of silence."
"If twin flames are so high vibration, why are their lives such a mess?","‘Twin flames' is another label given to misery by so-called twin flames experts.
How is it possible to have a serene life depending on another person? Other person always remains unpredictable.
I have heard one person can remain in karmic relation while making twin flames connection.
Now, this sounds stupid. No matter what name you give to something that is born out of duality it will always remain a mess.
Happiness comes from within. It should not depend on anything or anybody.
See the birds. Do they crave for twin flame?
Happiness is your nature, it is the very core of your being.
There is a zen story:-
Koyozo asked Zen Master Raizo, “How can I remain happy regardless of the situation?”
Raizo said, “When you wake up in the morning, ask yourself - do you want to be happy or sad today?”
If you choose to be sad - be sad regardless of what happens - even if you win a million-dollar lottery ticket. Be sad.
But if you choose to be happy, be happy regardless of you lose million dollars in gambling.

Happiness is the decision of your being, it should not depend on anybody else."
What difference can spirituality make to an atheist?,"Spirituality produces conscious atheist.
A conscious atheist is someone who experienced God. God is not a person, God is not in temples, Mosques and Churches.
When Friedrich Nietzsche says, “God is Dead.” and When I say, “There is no God.” It is different. First of all, there has never been God, the statement - “God is dead.” becomes false. When I say, “There is no God.” I say it from my experience, from my realization. If there is God then that is inside of you and nowhere else, because God is the experience of your true-self.
God is an experience like love. Can someone prove love? Love is to be experienced, any words that define love are nothing but poetry, not explanation. God is your ‘isness'. Without you neither you can be theist or atheist. Your being is God."
"What is happening to me? Haunted? Strange things are happening . The lights flicker around me when’s I feel too angry, sador pain. I haveweird visions and I hear voices of people who aren’t there, the lift keeps opening by itself near me andonly me.","You are going through thedark night of the soul'. There is an energy blockage at the heart chakra and your ego is resisting its absence and reinforcing its presence.
Your ego is having high and low like flickering.
This happens on the fourth astral plane of your being when dreams seem more like reality. There is a thin line between reality and imagination. The voices you are hearing because of the astral body which is causing your consciousness to jump out of your body and roam outside.
You need to check with some mystic it happens before the spiritual awakening and don't worry this is passing phase.
Check out the internet for - ‘Dark night of the soul'.
You will find many good advice."
"I notice people being uncomfortable around me. They cough, sneeze, scratch face and nose more frequently than normal. Is it because I have awakened Kundalini?","You are emitting negative energy. People become uncomfortable when you send negative thoughts waves.
You are full of sex energy and your sexual energy is being converted to repulsion.
Check out your diet and sexual intentions while meeting somebody, it has something to do with your being over sexual."
Can you truly live with our subconscious mind all the time in a day?,"The answer to this question is ‘yes' and ‘no'.
Unknowingly, you are referring to self-realization.
If one is self-realised then he lives only with a subconscious mind.
In fact, he uses his conscious mind when he speaks or writes otherwise he is as good as sleeping.
Self-realization rewires the brain to use the subconscious mind as default whereas the default option is the conscious mind for humans, which is always restless, chaos and commotion.
The subconscious mind is 92% of our brain and the conscious mind is only 8%.
By flipping the subconscious mind with the conscious mind life becomes enlightened.
The subconscious mind lives in the present only. It doesn't know the past or future.
This is a miracle of human brain that it can be reprogrammed thousands of times much like the computer BIOS.
Your question has a deeper meaning you might not know before."
"How do I know that I’m on the right spiritual path to enlightenment? Why does it seem that everything I thought I knew, I don’t know, and everything I thought I didn’t know, I kinda knew the whole time? Why do I feel completely lost and empty?","You are right on the path to enlightenment.
Because you are on the path of the unknown.
Every enlightened being carved his path, no two persons reached the enlightenment following the same path.
How can it be?
Everyone is unique and what they brought with them from previous lives is also unique.
But all who reached enlightenment had the same experience of the divine it can't be anything less or more.

Krishna, Jesus and Buddha they all reached the same destination - true self.
Emptiness is the true nature of our divine being everything else is worldly.
Those who dare to step into the unknown are bound to fall thousand of times, you might knock wrong doors several times before you reach right door.
Because knowing wrong as wrong is also step towards the right one.
Dare to fall, dare to be lost and dare to get up and run again this is how we reach the divine.

Can the body store traumatic memories from a past life?,"The body doesn't even store anything from yesterday. It is our brain that stores.
Regarding past lives, our cosmic unconscious mind stores traumatic memories from several of our past lives and traumatic memories of others around us like close relatives.
We don't only carry memories from our past lives, we carry memories of past lives of our loved ones also.
But it is not the nature of existence that everyone can remember that but very few can remember that.
You can try past life regression to know about your past lives."
Why is there a seemingly experienced separation when oneness is eventually the truth?,"If the sun simply forgets one day to rise in the morning, you will be dead in 30 minutes. We are connected even by sun rays, with the air every moment. If you don’t breathe you will die. We are deeply connected with everything else in millions of ways –that is the meaning of ecology.
A man goes on saying ’I’. The ego is a declaration that ”I am separate from others, separate from the sky, trees and sea” –but are you? Are you really separate from others?
Why do you feel you are separate?
Because it is very disorienting to feel that you are not the center of the world, that you are not the end and the purpose of the world, that the whole world has not been revolving around you. The ego gives you a rock to stand on, but the rock is imaginary.
You depend on air, water and food. How can you say you are not connected with the trees?
The idea of separateness is absurd. The idea of ‘I' as separate is absurd. It has no substance. It is made of the same stuff as dreams are made of.
The moment ‘I' is dropped, the whole becomes part of you. The ocean merges into the drop.

What cleans out your body of marijuana?,"The body has its own intelligence. Whether it is Marijuana or alcohol it will take few days to few weeks to clean out any foreign substance automatically.
It is a natural process and you can accelerate by drinking more water and juice.
You should not try to use another substance to clean out the first.
What is more important than cleaning out your body that you clean out your mind.
Work out daily whether you choose morning walk, cycling or Gym. Do something to strengthen your willpower.
Weight training at the gym works best and it gives you stepped-up goals every day that strengthens your willpower."
"Which of my chakras is blocked if I want to, but can't, cry?","Solar plexus or Manipura chakra is blocked but energy is moving between Solar Plexus and heart chakra.
Technically the blockage is at the heart chakra so the energy has settled at the solar plexus chakra.
You have blocked your heart chakra because you don't trust anyone or you have deep wounds that don't let you forget your past.
Solution:-
Surrender to God and trust God's will.
Forgiveness clears your heart chakra and third eye also. Forgive everybody including yourself especially your childhood."
"How do people live with their anxiety? I tried the same meditation every day for a few months but nothing seems to change. Also, can cannabis keep the anxiety going as I quit for nearly 3 months and that didn't seem to help ease it either?","I guess there is something wrong with your meditation.
How do you meditate?
I think you are doing concentration or contemplation.
Both of these activities exaggerate the anxiety.
Remember it takes time for the mind to learn silence.
Silence is not the nature of the mind. Restlessness is the very nature of the mind. Confusion is the way of mind. The mind exists because of confusion, and confusion causes anxiety.
You don't have to leave any habit to meditate. If it happens on its accord then it is natural.
Anything unnatural you do becomes a source of anxiety.
Try this:-
Wake up early in the morning and walk out to some park before sunrise and have a brisk walk for 3–4 miles.
Then sit comfortably, close your eyes and listen to the chirping of birds, feel the wind on your face.
That is called witnessing. Meditation is neither concentration nor contemplation.
Meditation is witnessing."
"Why do people claim that narcissists can't be twin flames? It is an unproven theory about souls. As all people have souls and narcissists are ideal mirrors to empaths, how could one state that as a fact?","Mystic Gurdjieff went to an extent and said - not every human has a soul.
I don't agree with him but I understand why did he say that? He wanted to emphasize that everybody should start the inner journey.
Those who don't search inside die like animals.
Narcissists and empaths are two extremes of ego like a sadist and masochist.
Who knows if there is the soul or twin flames?
It is moving in circles till you understand life is because you are.
There is nothing more important than your being. Your ‘isness' is divine.
‘God' is nothing less or more than you."
Are people beginning to feel that Twin Flames are unhealthy relationships?,"What else can it be?
A twin flame is the name given to your desire to know your true self. But those who don't dare to explore the unknown try to stick to duality. So-called twin flames experts are in illusions. They are no better than their clients.
Why do people fall in love again and again? Why do people get divorced and remarry 3,4 even 5 times?
Don't you think it is unethical to feel for somebody else while in relation? And then some spend the entire life with so-called karmic partner while fantasizing about twin flame seems like a dirty triangle. It is not easy to bear one person then handling two involvements is out of the question. If both are karmic partners and find their twin flames. Then it becomes a rectangle or crowd. The twin flames concept is just a mind game or at the most a device.
You will never find peace by depending on the other person.
Happiness should come from the inside.
Primarily everybody's search is a search for true-self. But very few dare to explore uncharted waters."
Are there any enlightened people who lead a normal life?,"Only enlightened people lead a normal life otherwise life is hell.
You can feel their presence but you can't differentiate between normal and enlightened being by appearance.
To feel their presence you need an open heart. One who lives in his mind will not even feel their presence.
In short, you get what you look for. Perhaps if you get to come across a single enlightened being in your entire life, your life will change.
How many enlightened beings do we know?
Very few. You can count on your fingers.
Enlightenment is as rare as Krishna, Jesus and Buddha."
How important do you feel clearing out emotional baggage is to reaching mindful consciousness and spiritual enlightenment?,"The only purpose of spirituality is to clear emotional baggage.
Otherwise, who cares about religion and spirituality.
As Buddha said - Life is suffering, and there is reason for that, reason is desires and attachments, if you can transcend desires and attachment you will reach Nirvana.
Death, separation and failure are the reasons for religions and enlightenment to exist.
Reaching pure consciousness and spiritual enlightenment are one and same thing."
How long does it take to acquire inner peace when you meditate?,"Restlessness is the very nature of the mind. Mind can be anywhere but not in present.
Meditation is something beyond mind. Meditation can help you reduce your erratic thoughts. But still, thoughts will remain.
Meditation is one and crucial part of the inner work. Meditation alone can not ensure inner peace.
If meditation is making you a bit silent then meditation is not working on you.
Meditation should shake you, it should give you a dark night of the soul.
Inner peace can not be ascertained till your mind remains. It will be one day peaceful other day hell.
Inner alchemy happens when you attain no-mind.
I totally disagree with people who keep meditating for decades. They have not worked on inner transformation. They have missed the point.
The only purpose of meditation is to transcend meditation when your life becomes a meditation. You don't sit even for 5 minutes to attain inner peace. Inner peace prevails in every moment of life. Meditation happens in every moment of life.
Your walking is meditation, your eating is meditation and your sleeping is meditation. You become a meditation.
Meditation is mean not the end."
What is the importance of being aware (in present moment) and being witness (Sakshi) of oneself in spiritual realization? Can one be both aware and Sakshi at same time? What is the relation between them?,"Being aware doesn't have the subject ‘I' and object.
Witness has ‘I' as subject and there is no object.
Being aware is the pure presence and there is no activity.
Witness is involved in an activity called witnessing.
Witnessing is the bridge between consciousness and awareness."
Can humans turn into animals?,"Human souls reincarnate as humans only. It is like if one fails in 12th class he doesn't fall back to 11th class.
Secondly, animals and birds don't have souls. Tiger is born as a tiger and dies as a tiger. Eagle is born as an eagle and dies as an eagle.
They don't get enlightened. Only humans have the freedom to remain as humans or become divine like Krishna, Jesus and Buddha.
This very freedom allows humans to be enlightened."
Did people who claim to have 20 past lives with their twin flame actually see them? Or they just making it up?,"Twin flame is a concept to help one overcome extreme emotional breakdown.
Everything that is said is just devices to implement the concept of reassuring that someone is there to accompany you in the journey of life.
Like you turn to God in case of death of loved one, twin flames particularly addresses the emotional breakdown or divorce.
The concept of Twin flame also helps in a stale marriages or one-sided love where one feels helpless.
Twin flames is good to prevent suicides because of failed marriages or broken hearts."
How can I remove myself from the Twin Flame journey? Am I crazy? Is this all in my head? Why does my heart ache so much w/o him?,"TF is the lowest rung of the spiritual ladder. The trigger can happen to be any incident that creates emotional havoc in your life.
It can be a breakup, divorce, death of a loved one. TF is common because the nowadays stable relationship between two persons doesn't last for long.
TF is common and safest to grow spiritually but TF doesn't trigger a spiritual awakening like full-fledged enlightenment.
Spiritual Awakening due to TF is yet another dependency on the outer thing.
True spiritual awakening can't be anything less than enlightenment.
TF can be a stepping stone but it can not lead to enlightenment.
Enlightenment is the ultimate flowering of humans into the divine.
“Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, you'll land among the stars.” - Norman Vincent Peale."
"If enlightenment is a return to our original nature, why is our original nature blissful?","Our true-self is devoid of ‘I' and ‘You' duality of mind.
When there is no duality then all negativity is dissolved, all our miseries stem out of dual nature. We seem to chase all good and avoid all bad. This dual nature results in frustration.
The mind only knows choices, our true-self is choiceless.
All miseries are in past and future, because our mind is everywhere but not in present.
Our true-self only knows to be in present.
Luckily, there is a way to transcend our mind and attain the no-mind.
State of no-mind is bliss."
Could I be confusing a Spiritua! Awakening for Metacognition?,"Absolutely yes. Any intellectual understanding is metacognition.
Spiritual awakening is a jump from mind to no-mind.
State of pure consciousness where there is no subject and no object.
Jump into awareness dissolves your mind's ‘I' or self into existence.
Now you become as vast as existence."
"Are the commentaries necessary for understanding the suttas? Each Sutta I read, I compared my understanding with the commentary and saw that my understanding of each sutta was the same as the commentary.","Commentaries have subtext meaning and underlying continuity string.
When I re-read any book after long time I get different meaning.
Suttas are the seeds and commentaries are alchemical.
If what you are saying is true then either you are enlightened or you have stubborn point of view.
Mind is very cunning it can see what it wants to see.
Understanding is intellectual and intellect doesn't work in spirituality.
You will have to live the suttas."
Do you believe God incarnated on Earth or Krishna and Rama were just humans capable of connecting to higher consciousness?,"I can tell you about Krishna.
Everyone including Krishna, Jesus and Buddha is an example of the possibility every human carries.
They are enlightened beings who visited earth to show us the way.
As mystics say - we all are divine having a human experience."
"There are people who claim third eye awakening in just one day, is it good?","First the fun part:-
I met a lady who claimed to awaken kundalini with one-touch. I asked genuinely how do you manage such a lie?
She (you will know whom I am talking about) said people are broken to an extent that they believe all sort of rubbish.
Now the real thing:-
Technically third eye is freedom from our human nature of duality. Every person has it and it is a body organ - the pineal gland.
But awakening it is a cumbersome process it requires intense inner work.
But the day it happens, it happens like a sudden clash of the thunders. You will not remain the same person your world will change - it will have more colours and brightness. It will have a depth of Super-HD.
You become spiritual.
It happened to me when my third eye opened.
When I could see the matter as matter and soul as a soul.
It hit me like sudden thunder. Everywhere I looked it was rotating eyeballs.
Even movie posters could only tell me people are souls.
Sun was a rotating eyeball. I could jump into the moon and back.
I was flying in the clouds. Opening of the third eye makes you weightless as if unburdening the weight of many lifetimes.
Spirituality happens when the third eye opens before that it is moving in circles."
"If we are the soul, a tiny fragment of God, who is blissful, then why are we suffering?","Sufferings are the human factor and the soul is divine.
We suffer because of desires and possessions.
As Buddha says, “Life is sufferings, there is the reason for sufferings and reason is desire and possessions and it can be corrected.”
Primarily, there are two reasons for sufferings:-
Attachments to possessions and relations.
Desires.
If you just become desireless you will become as pure as your soul.
The soul is something that is eternal, that never dies.
It is not only your soul that causes reincarnation but your desires and attachments.
To attain Nirvana you need to experience your soul."
"If we don’t face and accept our own darkness, how does that impact our soul?","Soul is pure it does get affected by our karma as it feeds back our body and mind with sense of good or bad.
If you don't accept your darkness it simply disconnects and that is how criminals are born.
Spirituality is transformational quest of finding your soul. Once you connect with your soul life becomes divine.
Krishna, Jesus and Buddha are examples of the possibility a man carries.
You too can be divine.
As mystics say, “ We all are divine having human experience.”"
"Is there any greater/ deeper meaning or spiritual reason behind why we are born in a specific part of the world, should we achieve something special there or are we meant to stay in the country forever just because you born there?","Absolutely not, life is a mystery to live not a puzzle to solve.
‘What if' is purely a mind game.
Why do you want meaning when all meanings lead to you?
Your being is the meaning.
If you are not then will there be meaning?
You are the meaning.
Live here and now.
Always turn your negative emotions to positive one.
Share positive things with people you love.
Find peace in doing small things."
"I'm in process of spirituality. Sometimes I feel someone invisible in my room. Is it an effect of process and real? If yes, then what I feel, is good or bad?","This happens when you are facing the dark night of the soul.
That means your heart chakra is blocked.
You need a master who can heal you otherwise you will waste decades.
My advice is get in touch with someone who knows DNTS and mere touch will heal you or maybe few weeks."
"Twin Flames, why do you believe that your twin is or isn't presently in your life? What has the Twin Flame experience taught you about yourself?","Twin means dual, Hell is Other. Don't you think so?
All twin flames experts are illusioned they don't know anything beyond duality.
True awakening happens beyond duality. Where you remain happy without the other person.
Twin flames experts don't even resize their life to the reality what else they can do to others.
Solution:-
Ultimate freedom is enlightenment where you don't need outer person to be happy.
Happiness will reside in yourself."
What are good habits of Zen followers?,They don’t trust in God. They don’t pray. They meditate. Teachings are in Koans. They don’t talk about Kundalini. Zen is the combination of Buddhism and Tao.
How do I align my inner chakras?,"Chakras are energy floodgates. They need to be addressed as inner transformational work. Any quickfix will only repress the roots of the imbalances in chakra system.
Whichever floodgate becomes overactive consumes all the energy of your body.
e.g. If you become angry then third chakra will exhaust the energy. If you are afraid then second chakra will exhaust the energy.
First chakra is sex chakra to procreate. Second Chakra is death chakra - fear - flight response.
Third Chakra is ego- your mind’s ‘I’ - fight response, Fourth is Heart Chakra -emotions of love and compassion.
You can balance these by surrendering to God and trusting his will. Live by heart not mind.
This is quickest way to balance your chakras."
"Why after my second spiritual awakening I am starting to question life and all the connections I have? A few days ago I was so sure of myself and trusted my intuition, but now I don't. Is this normal?","This is not awakening this is erratic spiritual experiences.
There is no first and second awakening.
You are moving in circles.
Awakening is possible for you but it will require intense inner work.
The inner transformation causes awakening. If you are yet not peaceful then it is not awakening but maybe a step towards awakening.
Awakening is as rare as Jesus, Krishna and Buddha.
It is not something available to everybody.
Those who say so are misleading you.
Don't take it as you are already enlightened."
"It is difficult for even humans to get enlightened, then what is the possibility of other living creatures being enlightened?","I condemn Teja…..
No animal is enlightened.
Only humans have the privilege to be enlightened.
They are enlightened in the sense that they don't know to be unenlightened. This enlightenment is unconscious.
That way even birds and trees are enlightened.
But they are totally identified with their identity.
Enlightenment means not to identify with your ego- identity.
I understand the problem to convey the message of something that can't be expressed in any language.
It is difficult to be enlightened that is why it is rare.
It is as rare as Krishna, Jesus, Mahavira and Buddha.
If somebody tells you, “You are already enlightened. “ Then you know what to do.
But if somebody tells you he is enlightened then you know what to do also."
When did you start to believe in spirituality?,"This is a weird question.
Believe and spirituality is diametrically opposites.
Spirituality is your nature. It comes from within.
I started to experience it when my third eye opened.
When I could see matter as matter and soul as a soul.
It hit me like sudden thunder. Everywhere I looked it was rotating eyes.
Even movie posters could only tell me people are souls.
Sun was a rotating eye. I could jump into moon and back.
I was flying in the clouds.
Spirituality happens when you become enlightened before that it is moving in circles like other answers."
How do I get rid of blocked negative emotions so I can allow my kundalini to awaken and flow freely?,"This is a tough one but let me try:-
Phase one:-
Surrender to God, let him decide and follow his will. If you surrender to God's will your life will become prayer.
This will open the second chakra.
Trust God that he will do what is right for you. Your trust will give you the courage to love life and everybody around you.
This will open your heart chakra.
Phase two:-
This phase is little tough. I shall share it later on.
First you complete phase one."
Why do I feel energy in my feet as I go through a spiritual awakening?,"In the beginning of spiritual awakening spare energy is accumulated at Muladhara Chakra and if there is excessive energy then it travels towards the feet.
If you normally walk barefoot then it will certainly travel towards feet.
Your Kundalini is yet to awaken it is being blocked by some of your negative emotions so the energy is traveling towards the feet."
How do spiritual leaders or gurus put hand on head or do blessing and transfer their internal energy to followers?,"When Kundalini energy starts to move upward then it can be transferred to other person by touch and thoughts.
If it is transferred by touch then it is called Shaktipat.
If it is transferred by thoughts then it is called grace.
Grace can be showered remotely.
Shaktipat requires special time and condition where disciple is ready to receive and strong enough to tolerate the energy surge.
Shaktipat is like sudden upsurge of Prana.
That is how in old times one could revive the dead person."
"If twin flames love each other so much, why don’t they just talk to each other?","The twin flames concept is a device to awaken you and transform you. It doesn't have substance and it is the lowest rung of the spiritual ladder.
It is not worth because it keeps you dependent on another person and the other person remains elusive. The duality in your nature is fed superficially.
All so-called twin flames experts also remain in the mirage of duality.
You are liberated when you jump out of duality and ride the tide of enlightenment.
Enlightenment is the ultimate human flowering where you don't need any outer things or a person to be happy.
Your happiness resides in your being."
Is enlightenment the realization that there is no enlightenment?,"This question is the result of the state just before enlightenment.
This is the state of letting go.
The epitome of desirelessness.
The seeking has to be started and it has to end also.
Enlightenment is when there is no desire including the desire to be enlightened and desire to be desireless.
If it can be reached by logic and inference then everyone would have been enlightened.
Enlightenment is showered when you don't need it.
It can happen with the fall of a leaf, falling of earthen pot, maybe the new moon or the full moon.
But there will be a reason without explanation."
How does philosophy explain how we can know/believe something and yet not really know/ Believe it or behave as if we know it?,"Assumptions are hypothesis. There are a thousand and one things we are given as our heritage.
Are you Hindu?
Are you Indian?
Are you human?
Who are you?
Isn't it all philosophic?
You better call philosophy - foolosophy."
If some famous personality is your twin flame and you don't know them and they ofcourse don't know you and this means you're in a separation period and as in you're a chaser and you realise that celebrity is your twin flame. Is it possible?,"What a wishful question. There is no twin flame. It is all the work of a few people who just happen to explore duality.
Freedom is beyond duality you can't be happy by depending on another person.
Happiness is your own characteristics. It should come from within.
It should be your own love.
Start loving yourself then you won't need another person."
"Is the law of attraction very useful in getting a stubborn ex back? If yes, then how do I do it?","Ex is not stubborn, you are being stubborn.
She has already moved on. Let her live her life.
And
You should understand that everyone who came into your life had a purpose, and the purpose is for you to grow.
Grow spiritually and accept that you were living without her before she came into your life as well now you are back to what you were.
Now nothing added or subtracted.
Stop wasting time move on otherwise you will fall into trap of Twin flame Drama or some fortune teller."
Why is “being choiceless” not a choice in OSHO's book “The Book of Nothing”?,"“Being Choiceless” is a choice. Neti, Neti -neither this nor that.
‘I love you’ is the same as ‘I don't love you.’ There is a subject as ‘I' and an object as ‘You'.
This is duality and you remain miser, till you think in terms of duality.
Divine is beyond duality- where you stand aloof as a witness."
What is the difference between an autobiography and a spiritual autobiography?,"There is a difference of POV(Point Of View).
Autobiography is the sequencing of events chronologically.
Spiritual Autobiography is the sequencing of events according to their spiritual meaning.
By changing the POV you get an entirely different story.
Spiritual autobiography is like connecting dots to draw spiritual meaning. It has a spiritual flavour.
A spiritual autobiography has more mysterious fiction contents than a plain autobiography."
What is the domain of our awareness to know the real existence of the universe?,"Pure consciousness is also known as awareness.
Awareness is the fabric of the universe.
Realization is in itself awareness.
Awareness means where subject and object is dissolved.
Where ‘I' and ‘You’ are dissolved.
Where neither ‘You' remains nor ‘God'.
Where your Manipura Chakra and Third Eye (Ajna Chakra) are dissolved.
Realization is beyond ‘Maya' of your mind - your unpolluted true-self."
How can awareness within help in realization?,"Pure consciousness is also known as awareness.
Awareness is fabric of the universe.
Realization is in itself awareness.
Awareness means where subject and object is dissolved.
Where ‘I' and ‘You’ are dissolved.
Where neither ‘You' remains nor ‘God'.
Where your Manipura Chakra and Third Eye (Ajna Chakra) are dissolved.
Realization is beyond ‘Maya' of your mind - your true-self."
How do you define unconditional love and its practice?,"Love is always unconditional if it is conditional then it is business.
How does duck recognise her ducklings? We all are connected. We all are part of whole.
It is just our individual ego or interest that makes us jealous, greedy and angry.
Understand this anything less than your “isness” will be a black hole and this universe will be the emptiness.
If you start to love yourself you will be granted blessings to love others.
Love yourself."
Can I be reincarnated as God?,"Everyone including Krishna, Jesus and Buddha is an example of the possibility a man carries.
As mystics say, “We all are divine having a human experience.’
Why do you want to wait for another birth? you can be God in this life also.
Yes, this is true you are reincarnated million of times till you become God.
The only purpose of humans is to become God- Divine."
A person did something wrong to me unknowingly but at that moment I was not knowing it then I did the same thing to that person again (purposefully) and the person didn't knew that I did that to him/her. Will I still get karma?,"It has already affected your soul that is why you have put this question on quora.
Wrong and right is the concept of the egoistic mind. There is nothing wrong or right.
It is bound to affect you because you did wrong purposely out of ego. You could have forgiven him/her. Other person did it unknowingly.
Other person is innocent, you are guilty.
To balance it just say “sorry” and forgive yourself also."
"Millions of people have had profound spiritual experiences, but many of these contradict others. Can we conclude that they are all imagined?","There are three states of mind - waking, dreaming and deep sleep.
The waking state is the Beta state of mind, which means the mind produces vibrations of 14-100cps(cycle per second). This also very high and erratic.
Dreaming state is Alpha state and it is around 8–13cps.
Theta state is state of great insights and all spiritual experiences happen in the Theta state. All poetry, music and work of art has deep gust of theta state. 4–7cps. Zen call it state of no-mind.
Delta state is lower than 3cps and this is the ultimate state of pure consciousness aka awareness which is attained on enlightenment.
This is state of utter silence and Hindu call it Turiya.
All States of mind arise from turiya. Turiya is waking-sleep where all illusions dissolve and one comes to know the truth of himself.
So experience of ultimate is same for Buddha, Jesus and Krishna and anything before it can have spectrum of interpretations."
"It's said that Nadi Sodhana purifies the nadis, but what exactly are impurities in the Nadis? Is it the same as samskaras that block the opening of chakra's? Can we practice Nadi Sodhana to open chakras, for example the heart chakra? Can you explain?","You can approach enlightenment mainly through three ways:-
Body - which includes Nadi Sodhana, that is path of yoga.
Heart - which is devotion and prayer.
Mind - which is the path of Dhyan and knowing.
Because our life has become very complex and we are exposed to many covert messages which condition our mind.
Path of meditation/mind is best in the new times or you can try combination of all three.
One of three will certainly click."
Can we mix Buddhist anti-capitalist philosophy with socialism like the 14th Dalai Lama did?,"Philosophies are the work of mind. It should be called foolosophy. It is more like moving in circles, nothing of substance.
If you are thirsty then you need water not formula for H2O.
Truth can be reached by meditation. If you are searching for your true-self then you need to be silent and still.
Little bit of philosophy maybe good for entertainment in some situations, but beyond that it will be of no use."
"I’m interested in religion but Christians act like God controls everything but once I ask why he would kill millions of people from Covid, they blame us and say we deserve it. Christians say that my only purpose is to worship God. This seems weird?","Religion is prison it will put thousand and one restrictions on you.
It is like born Christian and dies Buddhist. Does it make sense?
People waste time and energy some go to the Himalayas and some go to monasteries. But the search doesn't end.
It is like moving in circles.
What is Christian? What is Hindu? What is Muslim?
It is a prison of your consciousness. It limits you like a jail.
Set yourself free to find your true self. That is what you are."
What if your twin flame is someone that you feel they shouldn't be because of the role that they play in your life? There is no doubt in my mind this person is my twin flame I feel empty without them but who they are to me is what is confusing me.,"You know what are you looking for? You are already aware there is nothing like a twin flame.
Confusion is the key if something confuses you that means it is mind games.
The whole concept of the twin flame is ABS(absolutely Bu?l shi#t)
You've got to know there is ultimate true of yourself, but it's not twin flame.
How can't you be liberated by depending on other person? You are depending on God of your life..
But you are a sky just come out of illusion of TF."
Does imagining/visualizing scenarios while your eyes closed is technically sleeping? I was imagining some cool stuffs happening to me (not improper thoughts) while my eyes closed after an hour and it felt like I slept and it was a dream.,"There are three states of mind - waking, dreaming and sleeping.
Waking is a beta state, dreaming is an alpha and deep sleep is theta state of mind.
You were in the alpha state of mind which is a first meditative state and it is relaxing just short of deep sleep. But the mind enjoys the alpha state because of the fictional contents it has because in deep sleep you become unconscious.
Yes, you are right you had a long alpha state of mind which seems very alive yet peaceful."
"Does enlightenment lead to low self esteem, as the process of enlightenment leads to complete shedding of the notion of ""self""?","Absolutely not, enlightenment annihilates the identification with ego. An enlightened person knows he is not a mind or ego.
Enlightenment is a divine version of your ego where self is more compassionate and understanding.
He understands the people more accurately, he also feeds back the ego of others so that they become more human."
"Why I am stuck in spiritual journey after a consistent one year observation and giving attention to my each and every thoughts, I find no real change in me ,I feel helpless, completely alone, listening to JK Osho etc seems the same old pattern now?","Your very effort to reach is major block. If you start to feel helpless this is good news.
Seeking has to be started and it should also end in vain. Very nature of Enlightenment is desirelessness.
Your desires have to be annihilated including the desire to be desireless.
Enlightenment is when there is no effort otherwise you will keep moving in circle.
Start finding peace in doing small things.
Start living now and here.
Share positive things with people around you.
Start living by heart."
"Why I keep running when I'm the awakened one? I reach out just to be ghosted but given the opportunity for ""oneness"" by HIS definition I freak out w/ old energies and Again shut down; running all over again and pushing him further away. Why?","You are supposed to stop interacting with old people who suck your energy.
After awakening there are three golden rules:-
Never try to interact with one who triggered your awakening process. Just be thankful to them.
Never revisit places that caused your awakening. That is ghostland.
Have a purpose to serve those who need your advice.
If you keep going back you will keep coming back exhausted.
Treat everything before your awakening as your unenlightened previous birth and especially people who will backtrack your past."
Have you ever felt that this existence is illusion or matrix?,"The world is not an illusion it is real, yes it is a matrix but not the one you know.
A table is a table that is why you can sit on it.
The mind creates your world and the mind develops according to your family, religion and education. While growing because of an underdeveloped conscious mind till the age of 20, we tend to accumulate right as well as wrong in those growing age.
Till the time our conscious mind develops we already have our belief system which can vary substantially depending on our exposure.
This is how this world is an illusion but it is real too, it can prove to be an illusion if you transcend your mind and attain no-mind. Then you stand at the peak of consciousness and you can notice all the petty games mind plays.
Now you can say the world is an illusion but it will remain a matrix."
Do you feel that one can spiritually grow just as well without the presence of a Twin Flame? Why are some people so focused on finding and forcing a romantic relationship with their TF?,"TF is the lowest rung of the spiritual ladder. The trigger can happen to be any incident that creates emotional havoc in your life.
It can be divorce, death of loved one. TF is common because the nowadays stable relationship between two persons doesn't last for long.
TF is common and safest to grow spiritually but TF doesn't trigger a spiritual awakening like full-fledged enlightenment.
Spiritual Awakening due to TF is yet another dependency on the outer thing.
True spiritual awakening can't be anything less than enlightenment.
TF can be a stepping stone but it can not lead to enlightenment.
Enlightenment is the ultimate flowering of humans into divine."
How can we transform any human consciousness?,"Human consciousness has two modes one is human and the other is divine.
Why I say divine because we can be humans or God.
The moment we use word “God”. It gives us feeling of the person. This is totally superficial.
God is presence , God is “isness”. Because divinity is in your presence. Without your presence there can’t be any God.
Your “isness” is God. The bird chirping, the rain falling on the roof, the wind blowing through the trees... all this is included in your “isness”. Your participation in “isness” is divine - God.
Now realising your presence is peak of consciousness or superconsciousness.
Becoming God is the only purpose of our existence otherwise we are reincarnated millions of time."
Should one get rid of the bed and mattress of a person who passed away untimely after a brief illness?,"Of course, there is nothing wrong or right but it helps to get rid of everything that belonged to him.
Though this is a paradox because we are also part and parcel of the same person but the mind works that way.
The mind creates reality and there are many levels of reality now this is what forces us to do illogical things.
When someone dies he recollects everything including the energy of relations and attachments and then the soul leaves the body from him.
But the attachment from your side is real and not being there creates a hole in you so it is better to get rid of everything that belongs to the deceased."
What are the benefits of being more mindful?,"At its best, mindfulness keeps you in the present moment. It helps you calm your body and would calm your nagging internal voice, and you remain to present moments of life feeling energized and invigorated.
Far too often, rather than relaxing, it would begin to accelerate your heartbeats as your inner monologue would take a nasty turn, as unpleasant memories and feelings of failure and hopelessness flooding your mind. These events might become so frequent that you would like to relax into dreaming mode.
Mindfulness might cause heightened activity in the insular cortex which results in the loudness in the intensity of all your emotions. Eventually, your sensitivity to every slight change could become overwhelming causing full-on panic attacks.
On the other end, people experience this sense of numbness like saying, ‘I can't feel anything, I don't feel any love for my family.’
These are extreme cases of the mindfulness.
Mindfulness at its worst can cause sleep disorder also.
Psychologists say people sleep not because they want to sleep, they sleep because humans love dreaming. Nobody sleeps full 8 hrs, it is swinging between dreaming and deep sleep.
We don’t enjoy sleep, because in deep sleep we remain unconscious.
We tend to enjoy dreams much like a story.
Mindfulness has benefits to an extent and beyond that, it becomes a painful monologue."
What happens if I never chase my twin flame ever again?,"You will be enlightened if you don't chase because either you will understand it is BS or you will start enjoying your aloneness.
What will you get believing in twin flame -dependency?
The whole concept of the twin flame is BS.
YOU can be perfectly all right without the sh*t.
Eat, drink and sleep.
Be merry!"
Who is God according to the law of attraction?,"Certainly God is not a person. God is not the matter. The moment we use word “God”. It gives us feeling of the person. This is totally superficial.
God is presence , God is “isness”. Because divinity is in your presence. Without your presence there can’t be any God.
Your “isness” is God. The bird chirping, the rain falling on the roof, the wind blowing through the trees... all this is included in your “isness”. Your participation in “isness” is divine - God.
That is why law of attraction works. Is there any other reason that can cause “law of attraction” to work?
Your presence is perfect synthesis of divine."
"Why do people like reading YouTube comments, despite knowing these to be unnecessary? Are YouTube comments entertaining?","Confirmation or observations
Primarily people want to verify their point of view so they read the comments to confirm their point of view. This is mundane side of mind.
Some intelligent people do it for observations. Observations become springboard for new ideas and this is creative side of the man.
In the times of Growth hacking comments and reviews are money. One can use comments to invent new products (videos in case of youtube) or services."
"Can a kundalini rising happen under the effects of allucinogens? If so, is it the same as a normal rising? What do you do if you had one? It was a very long time ago. Am I still experiencing the outcomes?","Psychedelics are used by some people to induce kundalini awakening but it is a long process.
Aghoris and few secret clans of Shiva in suburbs of Pakistan use psychedelics to induce awakening.
It does induce profound superconsciousness but it remains for a few hours and temporary.
LSD is one of the few psychedelics which is used by many people.
But it is temporary it is also addictive using psychedelics for awakening is not worth because psychedelic itself becomes a hurdle so few like Ram Das might have attained awakening but that awakening is not whole.
One remains inside all the worldly things if awakening is caused by the psychedelic.
This is not true awakening in itself. By the way man lives all his life utter unconsciously and Buddha said, “Whatsoever you do unconsciously is a sin.”
PS: KUNDALINI AWAKENING AND AWAKENING IS ONE AND SAME THING."
"How Animals, birds will attain Liberation?","Only humans can attain liberation. Birds are birds and animals are animals and they remain that.
Loin will be born as loin and die as the loin. Vulture will die as a vulture. Because humans have special consciousness that makes him capable of attaining enlightenment.
Birds and animals make food chain and humans are out of that food chain.
Jesus, Krishna, Muhammad and Buddha are examples of possibility of the man carries.
As mystics say, “We are divine having human experience.”
Don't be human, be divine."
Where are the 114 chakras located?,"There are 72000 nadis (energy channels) and 114 chakras. There are 3 major Nadis (Ida, Pingala and Sushumna ) and 7 major chakras, 21 minor chakras and 86 micro chakras in human body. Among the 114 chakras, 108 chakras reside within the body and the other 6 are outside the body. Among the major seven chakras, one is present outside the body, over the head region - Sahasara Chakra.
There are 21 minor chakras distributed all over the body. Head, heart, navel, throat and base of the spine are the five main areas of major chakras. Minor chakras reside in our hands, legs, tongue, clavicles, shoulder, eye, ear and nose. All chakras are not active all the times, some are prominent and some are dormant. When your 7 chakras are activated then gradually all other minor and micro chakras are activated with the regular sadhana for years.
Mainly, one can actually feel the movement of the energy through the chakra and one can also control the flow of energy that is how Shaktipat is performed by the enlightened Master. You need to start working on major 7 chakras and rest will be activated with an overflow of the Prana (energy) automatically."
Can a soul reappear in all its past forms at a time in the same place?,"The soul can appear in all last 7 forms and it happens just before death.
Whatsoever you accumulate in this life your love, hatred and thousand and one thing are recollected at hara and then your soul leaves your body from Hara.
Now if you have lived your life by your heart then the soul will leave your body from the heart chakra and next life will start from a compassionate life. If you lived an enlightened life then your soul will merge into existence there will not be any reincarnation.
You can try past life regression to see your past lives but beware it is not nature of existence. If you try then be ready for anything."
"What are the deepest levels of self-awareness, and how can they be attained?","Awareness is the fabric of the universe. Technically there is nothing like ‘self' in awareness.
Self is the component of consciousness. Consciousness has the subject ‘I' and object ‘you’. Awareness doesn't have a subject and an object.
Pure consciousness is known as awareness.
Now the tricky part - How can we attain it?
Attaining something means there is ‘I' the attainer and the object of attainment.
So you can't attain it by desiring but it will be available to you while you slip into desirelessness.
Your every desire including the desire to be desireless has to be annihilated.
Then it will come running to you like a cool breeze. It will come to you when you don't need it."
How do we definitively verify and agree that another person is enlightened (in Buddhism)? Please cite sources to support your answer.,"If you have to verify then definitely either he is not enlightened or you are 100% logically in your head.
Those who have eyes can see the enlightened person.
Very few 1-2% of people are enlightened so it is rare you will ever come across any enlightened person.
So it is futile to see everyone through the lens of “yes enlightened” and “not enlightened”.
How many people have seen Jesus, Krishna or Buddha?
Not many.
Even birds, animals can feel the presence of enlightened being, if you can't then you are superhuman who lives in his perfect head, not the heart.
You need a perfect heart to see enlightened being and perfect eyes to feel his presence."
"Is one's ego the greatest obstacle in the advancement of one's own enlightenment, or do other factors play a role as well in hindering enlightenment?","First thing first.
What is ego?
Ego is mind's ‘I'.
What is enlightenment?
Dissolution of ego into existence.
What does remain after enlightenment?
Pure presence of being.
How is it different?
Pure presence just radiates compassion, it doesn't know anything other than presence.
Ego has many layers - positive and negative.
Layer one: In this people live artificial lifelike if they go to the funeral they cry with others but their tears mean nothing. They say Hello but to avoid people. Frederick S. Perls has called this layer CHICKENSHIT.
Layer two: This layer is pure ego. It is like - I AM PRESIDENT OF AMERICA. I AM HUSBAND OF MISS UNIVERSE. People in this layer are bit better than layer one but dangerous because they become politicians, police officers etc. Frederick S. Perls has called this layer BULLSHIT.
Layer three: When something bad happens in layer two like the death of a loved one or divorce than people like poets, authors, musicians, lyricists or people good at heart fall to the third layer. This layer is called CHAOS. Here people either become alcoholic or druggist or go back to layer two. If one remains meditative and aware then he enters the next layer.
Layer four: This is DEATH layer, where you touch death experiences of yourself and your loved one. If one remains aware of this layer by meditating then he or she enters the LIFE phase. To be frank, in this layer you need a MASTER who can give birth to your new ego otherwise you will move like a zombie or you will revert to layer two. When this layer is being peeled this is Awakening of Heart Chakra. This is also called 'dark night of the soul'. This term was first mentioned in a poem written by the 16th-century Spanish mystic and poet St. John of the Cross. From here you are most likely to descend or transcend. Be careful and remain aware.
Layer five: This layer is called LIFE. Your new ego has to take new form and new dimensions of a loving and compassionate life. You can become Epicurious or Buddha if you remain aware. From here MASTER can't help you. You will be guided by your wisdom.
Layer SIX: This layer is called BLISS. If you come to this layer then you have the possibility of becoming BUDDHA- full of pure love and awareness.
Break the shell of every layer before you experience first SATORI and then Enlightenment."
What is the protective layer of consciousness?,"Consciousness itself creates a layer upon awareness. That metal construct is “ego”. Like skin and muscle is container of bones ego is container of awareness.
But ego itself has many layers to protect our existence at physical and psychological levels.
Ego has physical layer (body), emotional layer (heart) and metal (logic, perceptions and belief system etc.)
Consciousness = (Conscious) Mind + Aware(ness).
Consciousness doesn’t have layer, it creates protective layers of our being. That is why it is difficult to transcend mind because how can you cut a knife with same knife.
That is why enlightenment is rare."
Can meditation change our paradigm?,"Human mind is chaos, noise and commotion. It doesn’t keep quiet even while you sleep. It keeps thinking about past and planning about future. Any effort to keep it quiet makes it revolt and it hits back even more powerfully.
Mind can’t be conquered by the mind itself. We need something higher than mind to conquer it and meditation is the only thing known to man higher than mind.
Even meditation can not silence your mind but there is a state beyond the mind and that is no-mind. To silence the mind your brain has to learn to go in and come out of the no-mind, where all your thoughts vanish and then you become master of your mind.
This possibility is hard to attain but it is possible and then there will be no paradigms you will enjoy your being in now.
The answer is - “Yes, meditation can cause total paradigm-shift.”"
Is hope a good thing or bad thing?,"Hope is God. Hope lets you to be in present. God is also hope. When you surrender to God the same thing happens when you hope.
It throws you back to the present moment. Hope is in our blood and bones, without hope one becomes suicidal.
When there is no hope, even then there is a desire to live and the desire to live keeps our hope alive.
Hope is neither good nor bad. Hope is the basis of human existence."
I found the 'Zen Teachings of Bodhidharma' quite difficult to grasp. Should I have gone for another Mahayana book which makes it easier for me to understand the former?,"Truth is one but you can approach it in two ways either you approach truth through mind or heart.
Buddhism, Zen, Jainism and Taoism are religion of mind. They believe if the mind can be dropped you can attain truth. There is no need for God, prayer and mantra. These are the religion of dhyana.
Hinduism, Judaism, Christianity and Islam are a religion of the heart. They believe path goes through heart and heart has to be dissolved into the divine. There is divine God is a necessary hypothesis. These are religions love and prayer.
Thought the ultimate both reach is the same.
If the very word God gives you great awe then Zen is not for you. But if God word has no meaning then you can take the path of zen.
As I can see you are Hindu it will be difficult for you to walk the path of zen.
You start exploring meditation first then if you can deny God then you can start reading Zen."
"When you come at peace with death, could that mean you could die soon?","When you come at peace with death, you learn to live death and life become available to you at its fullest.

Those who avoid death are bound to remain miserable.
All our fears are rooted in the fear of death. Fear of unknown is fear of death. While death starts to happen every day after your birth. Every day pushes you closer to death.
People celebrate b'day every year when it should be called death day because one more year is subtracted from your life.
Making peace with death is not a conscious decision it is understanding that sets you free of miseries of life."
"If everybody has a spirit guide, why does the spirit guide let you do bad things?","A spirit guide is our true-self. It is our divine version.
As mystics say, “We all are divine having a human experience.”
It guides us so that we learn, we keep learning, we keep reincarnating millions of times.
We keep making mistakes so that we learn the ultimate lesson - the lesson of enlightenment that liberates us from the cycle of birth, life and death."
"As you become more spiritually enlightened, is it common to choose freedom over marriage?","There is no quantity of more or less of enlightenment.
It is like I am home, you can't say my right foot has reached home.
It is returning to the source and the source is one -pure consciousness aka awareness.
Less and more is the language of duality and enlightenment happens beyond duality.
If you realise that your happiness should not depend on outer things you will also understand Marriage is one of the universal social institutions established to control and regulate the life of mankind. It is closely associated with the institution of the family. In fact, both institutions are complementary to each other. It has no spiritual meaning.
Enlightened beings prefer freedom because they don't need another person to be happy. Happiness becomes his nature."
Can you meditate all day?,"The sole purpose of the meditation is to attain deepest meditative state for the rest of the life.
That is what enlightenment is all about.
The deepest meditative state is known as Turiya. The brain of the one who attains Samadhi is rewired for new normal - Turiya. Turiya becomes his nature.
This state is known as delta state of mind, which is exactly close to pure consciousness aka awareness- the fabric of the universe.
Enlightened person remains in deepest meditation 24X7."
How can a twin flame connection permanently be removed?,"Yes, certainly.
Twin flame connection happens in the Alpha state of mind with frequent shifts to Theta state which feels divine and spiritual.
It is same energy which causes higher realities closer to God like self-realisation and enlightenment.
Most of people remain stuck in this state all their life. Running from one thing to other, one person to other.
It is certainly possible if you open yourself to higher possibilities of yourself as soul (true-self).
Twin flame is lowest spiritual experience with possibility of highest known as enlightenment. Twin flames is a rabbit hole because it again depends on other person and other person is always unpredictable, so it is destined to end in frustration.
The day your third eye opens your all false bridges are burnt and you are liberated."
"When on a spiritual path, is it normal to think of romance as somewhat nonsensical?  It seems that people just want to use each other.","Spirituality is about living blissfully in aloneness. An awakened person doesn't need anybody else to be happy.
An enlightened person knows romance is a sexual pleasure which again depends on another person.
The state of enlightenment is orgasmic. An enlightened being is making love 24 X 7. His whole body becomes Kam-indri. Kam-indri means sexual. He becomes walking erected genitals.
The sexual orgasmic experience is the basis of enlightenment, it is nonsensical for an enlightened person to be romantic. But the ladies around him will feel sudden urge of sexual intercourse or some might ejaculate involuntarily."
How do you explain that some enlightened beings still feel the need to worship entities called gods?,"This is something I wonder about.
Everyone in past including Buddha, Krishna, Jesus, Muhammad represents the possibility a man carries.
They situated their stand on their experience. The experience of the divine is the same for all of them but their interpretation is different because of their knowledge and understanding. What they said is not absolute, but what they experienced as God is absolute.
The day you will transcend your limiting mind you will literally laugh at the Bible, Quran and Gita."
"Why hasn't Jesus made a peep in 2,000 years? Tends to make me think it's all bullshit.","Everyone in past including Buddha, Krishna, Jesus, Muhammad were just examples of the possibility a man carries.
They situated their stand on their experience. The experience of the divine is the same for all of them but their interpretation is different because of their knowledge and understanding.
The day you will transcend your limiting mind you will literally laugh at the Bible, Quran and Gita."
How does egg eating affect our spiritual journey?,It doesn't
"If people claiming to be 'enlightened' are truly enlightened, why do they still spend so much of their time reading enlightenment answers on Quora?","Why did Gustave Eiffel build Eiffel tower?
Because he knew he could build such a masterpiece and he wanted to share his marvel. He wanted to give something beautiful to this world.
We all have a natural tendency to share something rare and when it comes to something as rare as enlightenment then it is more important because enlightenment is beyond human experience.
It also reinforces that humans can be divine.
As mystics say, “We all are divine having a human experience.”"
What if humans become egoless and humble? Can humans be free from suffering?,"Absolutely Yes.
But the magic is not in ‘becoming', magic is in ‘being'.
‘Becoming' is unnatural and artificial.
Two lazy bulls become almost cow-like and the owner of these bulls started treating them useless and stopped feeding them both bulls used to eat whatever they could find just to be alive.
And they keep resting all day under a tree on the fields.
After getting fed up with these lazy bulls farmer bought a new young bull to plough his fields.
The new bull was healthy and hard working. He used to work all day and used to get healthy meals every evening.
People started to talk about hard-working bull.
Lazy bulls started calling him fool.
When people started to bring their cows for mating to this bull, one of the lazy bull started working in the fields then other bull asked him “What happened? Why are you being fool? Are you interested in cows?”
While ploughing field bull said, “We should work hard otherwise we both will be in the place of cows.”
Don't try to be humble, people will take you for a ride. You won't survive in market without ego. Ego is essential to survive in this competitive world."
"Can Buddhism be a method to cultivate morality? But this raises the question, are other people who do not practice Buddhism immoral or lacking morality? If not, what kind of ‘special’ morality can Buddhism cultivate and why should anyone choose it?","Buddhism says we all are Buddhas. What we experience as human stands between you and Buddhahood.
Morals are part of our conscience and it is created by society, religion and education. Morality is a social code.
Buddhism teaches amorality which is neither moral nor immoral."
"Many gurus say that if a seeker is sincere in his search for the self, he instantly finds God. I have been seeking for 4 years. Does this mean that I am not sincere in my search?","Your seeking has a major human psychological flaw - that is God.
God is the biggest lie invented by the man.
You should be seeking your true-self.
“Who am I?” And “I am that” are those seeking pointers.
Your truth is your true-self.
God is not a person, God is an experience of your true-self.
It is your wrong perception that is creating a delusional path to thousands and one thing hence you are going away from your true-self not closer.
There is nowhere to seek, but in."
"Do you agree with the power of the ""law of attraction""?","This Universe is an expansion of energy and life is the crystallisation of that energy. What we see as matter is energy, what we experience as thought and consciousness is also energy. Everything is a manifestation of the same energy in infinite forms.
Tibetan Lamas say, “Universe is vibrations.” The universe is a dance of positive and negative, two opposites - Duality. If you take the tiniest unit of matter - atom. It is vibrations - protons, neutron and electrons. The energy is vibration.
Our soul belongs to awareness and awareness is pure energy, the fabric of the universe.
That means what you experience as a human is a shell of pure energy.
The basic unit of cosmic energy is awareness.
Our mind is also vibrations. It vibrates based on the thoughts we have.
Here comes in Law of attraction:-
The law of attraction works on the tricking your subconscious mind by making it believe something you want but you do not have.
The subconscious mind works in images and emotions, that is why we dream in pictures. By creating continuous suggestions by conscious mind we can influence the subconscious mind and the subconscious mind works with the existence to make it a reality.
With visualizations, suggestions and affirmations we can definitely influence our subconscious mind to work as a genie in the bottle or Aladdin’s lamp."

How can I get a spiritual power?,"Spirituality and power are diametrically opposites poles.
Spirituality is about just being. The silence of the running water. The songs of the swans. Spirituality is poetic and power is aggressive.
Aggression and spirituality have no commons.
Spirituality is love and power is fight."
What is the difference between being spiritual awakened or being mentally ill?,"Spiritual awakened person is consciously mad as he doesn’t conform to society value system whereas mentally ill is the person who is unconsciously mad , he also doesn’t conform to society value system.
Before spiritual awakening one has to go through madness which is a phase of deprogramming his hardwired ethics, conscience and morals in his unconscious and subconscious mind.
Spiritual awakening is death of the illusion we know as “I” or to be more precise it is psychological death.
What happens in physical death also happens in psychological death but it happens on deeper level because brain has to survive and has to be rewired for new normal.
One has to become mentally ill before resurrection."
Can Buddhism and Christianity coexist?,"Christianity is of forgiveness and love. Buddhism is of Dhayan.
Without forgiveness, love can't happen, without love meditation can't happen.
Forgiveness clears your heart and love starts to flow like a river to the ocean.
In the innocence of love and trust, one becomes as innocent as a child and then the magic of meditation happens.
Christianity and Buddhism is the perfect match."
"According to modern science, humans evolved from monkeys. Can Jainism scientifically disprove it?","Man is work of extreme intelligence of existence. There is no other life form as intelligent as humans.
Evolution of man started from the sea as fish. The woman's womb has exactly the same amount of salt as the sea. For nine months one has to float in the salted water of the womb.
What we know as God is the creative force of existence that is why mystics say, “ God is inside of us.”
Every living being has individuality as some life form. Monkey lives and dies like a monkey. Donkey will live and die like a donkey.
Only human can transcend individuality and can live as pure consciousness aka awareness.
He can become a walking tree.
The basic unit of cosmic energy is awareness.
This Universe is an expansion of energy and life is the crystallisation of that energy. What we see as matter is energy, what we experience as thought and consciousness is also energy. Everything is a manifestation of the same energy in infinite forms."
What is the difference between the Turiya state of consciousness and Samadhi?,"There are three stages before enlightenment.
Stage One is when seeker starts to have Satori. Satori is glimpses of Samadhi. It happens for few minutes or hours.
Stage Two when seeker enters Samadhi. Samadhi remains for 13 days when the brain of the seeker is rewired for the new state of mind, known as no-mind.
Stage Three when the seeker is rewired for Turiya. Turiya is permanent Samadhi. It takes 9 months to rewire the brain for Turiya.
What is Turiya?
Like Satori is glimpses of Samadhi, Samadhi is 13 days Glimpse of Turiya.
Turiya is waking-sleep. It has something of waking and something of sleeping but it is beyond human experience that is why it is called God's state."
Why do spiritual traditions teach to abandon physical desires & the world? Why can't we create our realities through the law of attraction (like God's mind created the universe) so that there would be no physical suffering/no need for enlightenment?,"First of all, your concept of God is a fallacy. It has a root in your presumption that there is God.
If God's mind created this universe then who created God. We should worship that because the one who created God must be greater than God.
Simple logic says - There is no God or rather God is an experience.
Why can't we create our realities through the law of attraction?
How many times the law of attraction worked for you?
Is there any end to your desires?
The day you get what you desire, it loses its value. Whatsoever you have doesn't have value.
You want Red Mercedes the day you get it you start to look for other higher options available to you.
Why do spiritual traditions teach to abandon physical desires & the world?
If you remain in Samsara you will remain burning with desires and attachments. Samsara means wheel. Wheel of life will keep moving if you don't deliberately opt-out of it.
The desires and attachments are the primary reason for sufferings because it always results in frustration.
The only way to be blissful is to be enlightened, there is no other way."
What do the enlightened think about the possible collapse of the society like described in “How Everything Can Collapse: A Manual for our Times”?,"This possible collapse has already happened to the enlightened one.
Anything that is identification in a society like ambitions, goals and completion have to vanish to be enlightened so it is not something to happen in future. It has already happened in an enlightened being.
The mind is a pack of desires and enlightenment is destruction of desires.
Enlightenment happens when the desire to be desireless is also vanishes like a last morning star.
Conceptually, it is nothing new to enlightened being it would be replay of something that has already happened in him."
What is the core idea of Buddhism?,"Life is suffering.
There is reason for sufferings and it can be corrected.
Desires are the root cause of sufferings.
Nirvana is available to every human."
"When asleep, I sometimes feel as though I cannot breathe in a dream. I will soon awaken, face down, gasping for air and realizing I was actually unable to breathe. Like I wasn`t ever dreaming; I was actually suffocating. What should I know? Help plz!","This seems to be a problem with your Hara. Hara is exactly 2 inches below your navel.
This is the point of survival and fight or flight response of your survival instinct.
This is also death centre. In the old times, Hara-Kiri was Japanese Ritual Suicide for warriors who couldn't fulfil his promise or oath. Hara-kiri was performed by stabbing knife at hara by the samurai.
What is the solution?
All I can suggest you something everyone should follow regardless of a good or bad situation in life.
Surrender to God, let him decide and follow his will. If you surrender to God's will your life will become prayer.
Trust God that he will do what is right for you. Your trust will give you the courage to love life and everybody around you.
Only surrender and trust can make your being joyful regardless of the situation"
Did the universe ever listen to your wishes?,"Yes, but not the way you know.
As Lamas say, “Universe is vibrations.” the universe is a dance of positive and negative, two opposites - Duality.

Our mind is also vibrations. It vibrates based on the thoughts we have.

When does mindfulness become toxic?,"At its best, mindfulness keeps you in the present moment. It helps you calm your body and would calm your nagging internal voice, and you remain to present moments of life feeling energized and invigorated.
Far too often, rather than relaxing, it would begin to accelerate your heartbeats as your inner monologue would take a nasty turn, as unpleasant memories and feelings of failure and hopelessness flooding your mind. These events might become so frequent that you would like to relax into dreaming mode.
Mindfulness might cause heightened activity in the insular cortex which results in the loudness in the intensity of all your emotions. Eventually, your sensitivity to every slight change could become overwhelming causing full-on panic attacks.
On the other end, people experience this sense of numbness like saying, ‘I can't feel anything, I don't feel any love for my family.’
These are extreme cases of the mindfulness.
Mindfulness at its worst can cause sleep disorder also.
Psychologists say people sleep not because they want to sleep, they sleep because humans love dreaming. Nobody sleeps full 8 hrs, it is swinging between dreaming and deep sleep.
We don’t enjoy sleep, because in deep sleep we remain unconscious.
We tend to enjoy dreams much like a movie in the theatre.
Mindfulness has benefits to an extent and beyond that, it becomes a painful monologue."
Is kundalini syndrome just a physical and mental roller coaster of everything that one goes through when one's energy becomes active?,"It is an involuntary roller coaster upward movement of energy, we know as Prana.
Humans are as good as an animal when energy moves downward but the day it moves upward human becomes divine.
What was earthly becomes heavenly? This possibility makes possible the birth of Jesus, Krishna and Buddha.
Kundalini is available to every human but very few are able to realise Kundalini to 7th plane of existence otherwise most of the people are born and die in first four planes.
It is kundalini that defines God or divine in humans and that is how we know the existence of God or Godliness.
Next time you think about Kundalini, just feel the Godliness inside of you."
Does our soul (consciousness) keep our physical body alive?,"The soul is not consciousness, it is a bit deeper than consciousness. It is an awareness that is closer to the soul. The soul is your true-self, which is never born or dies. It is eternal.
Yes, the soul keeps your body alive. It causes your body to function as a human.
Do animals and birds have a soul?
No, because they have a fixed map. They can't be otherwise. A lion is born and dies as the loin. A vulture will remain vulture all its life and will die as a vulture.
Only humans have free will to become a devil or divine. That is how we have Jesus, Krishna and Buddha.
Answer to your question is yes soul keeps us alive as humans. But most of the people live like animals.
So the second answer is “No”, soul is not required to be alive."
"Begging the question Does also using the ""mind"" to understand the mind ""beg the question"". Anything that the mind comes up with is therfore questionable and cannot, with complete certainty, explain the mind (the very thing in question)?","Any conclusion is based on the limited premise of the mind. The mind is well-versed in creating a dream of not being in a dream.
That is why everybody creates his world around him. When two people fight then actually two world fight. Our logic, perceptions and understanding are limited to our experiences and second-hand knowledge.
The mind creates a world around it that is why Hindu call it Maya. To understand mind one needs to attain no-mind, one needs to transcend the mind and its logic.
And
That is what we know as enlightenment. Total annihilation of mind as a pilot and once you attain no-mind all illusions of mind are destroyed once and forever, ‘you' and ‘I' of mind dissolve, you become Tabula rasa.
You are liberated."
"Is it true Buddha said “seek for the truth”? If so, what source?","“Seek for the truth”, Buddha is talking about your truth - your true-self , which is unpolluted of the conditioning of society, religion and knowledge.
Yes, these are pollution for your true-self.
Your true face is the face before your birth. Try to find that true-face- eternal- what you have is the consciousness dusted with the knowledge and ambitions.
Your true-self is your truth not what you search in spiritual books.
Truth is inside."
"Why should we pay attention to what we dream, or not, because dreams are not reality? What is it our unconscious may be trying to tell us when we wake up from particular dreams upset and even crying?","Dreams are created by our unconscious mind which is conditioned by our DNA. DREAMS are either based on fears or desires.
All fears are fight or flight response coded in our fear of death. All desires are sexual and based on our basic survival needs.
Dreams have no meaning until dreams are lucid. Lucid dreams can be rare insights and can help in predicting the future.
Lucid dreams happen in the Theta state of mind which is very close to a deep meditative state of mind and if the dream happens in Delta state of mind then it is almost preplay of the future.
The mind is vibrations. Deeper it goes closer it reaches to future reality otherwise dreams are mind games of desires and fears."
What is the difference between waking up chakras and waking up kundalini when the method used to meditate is the same?,"There is nothing can be done to chakras directly as they reside in unconscious mind and cosmic unconsciousness. Until and unless you have access to subtle body everything you do is mind games nothing else.
Remember: Kundalini is awakened and chakras are balanced.
There is nothing as such awakening of chakras.
When the kundalini is awakened then the work of balancing of chakras is required not before that.
All thousand and one exercises are nothing but a trash of achieving mind. Mind which can create dream of not being in dream itself. It is like dog chasing its tail.
First is Kundalini awakening then comes the balancing of chakras."
Is our consciousness temporary or permanent?,"Consciousness is fickle like emotions.
What is consciousness ?
Consciousness = Conscious Mind + Awareness.
Conscious mind keeps changing its focus and hence consciousness is like a wave in the ocean.
You go to market you see upside down billboard. You start thinking whether it is put deliberately or by mistake. You see pink shoes it takes your attention for few seconds and then you again and again think about fancy pink shoes. You have bought Rayban you keep looking for Rayban on other faces. Consciousness is ever-changing its focus and that is how we are able to function in daily life.
Awareness is permanent. Whether you sleep or awake,it doesn’t vary."
Do you think the enlightened people only experienced hallucination by the brain?,"Absolutely not, that is why we have the Bible, Gita and Quran.
Divine is beyond the hallucinating mind of humans. Man is fast asleep once in thousands of years Krishna, Jesus and Buddha are awakened on earth and save humanity.
You are fast asleep. You see a girl and you start dreaming about making love to her day and night. You go to watch movie just to escape from yourself then you float in pictures on screen and come out crying for pictures on the curtain. You go to pub to forget yourself every evening.
You are not only fast asleep but also hallucinating. Hallucinating with desires and attachments always dreaming and planning.
Enlightenment is liberation from hallucination."
What does it mean if I am constantly subconsciously humming to the point where my throat hurts? I find myself humming a song or just a random note out of nowhere.,"You are in prayer mode. It is your devotional self. You have experienced divine that is why your being is trying to replicate that experience.
In short, your kundalini is awakened and first intercourse of root chakra and sacral chakra has happened.
This brings in kind of joy that sets you on fire of divine and makes you sing."
"To attain 'Moksha' the utmost desire and devotion to God is necessary, but one cannot get peace of mind until he becomes alone, free from desires. What are the thoughts through which one can attain 'moksha'?","Moksha is about thoughtlessness, it is about no-mind. No thought can lead you to moksha.
Desires and attachments are also thoughts. Desires and attachments are holes in your soul.
What creates holes in our soul is an obsession of material belongings and attachments. There are two things which keep us bound to the material world:-
Possessions (achievements feed our ego).
Relations (especially toxic).
Desires create the bounding to the material world and extinguish our kundalini and we exhaust spiritual energy and remain miserable.

As you might know, man's persona has seven chakras, seven centres and from all sides, the centre that is activated pulls in what is amenable to it. The centre becomes receptive. If the centre for anger is activated, it will draw in waves of anger from all around it. If the centre for love is activated, from all directions it will attract toward itself waves of love. If the centre for passion is energized, from all sides waves of lust and passion will race toward it. A man becomes like a deep abyss and from everywhere all that he craves flows into it.
Desires or obsessions are the main cause of our sufferings and this is what keeps us in this Maya.
What to do to fill holes in our soul?
Stop identifying with possessions and achievements. Stop trying to possess others.
What Buddha said 2500 years ago is more valid today because now we are deeply conditioned to competition and relationships. We have become more unconscious of our true-self. We have started to enjoy our slavery to our desires.
There is a thin line between desires and needs. Needs are basic and desires are unlimited.
Relations have become more of business than understanding the emotions of others.
What if you live just for today. What if you enjoy being with people. What if you find peace in small things. Life will be more of joy than a sobbing moron.

Are chakras real or just an imposition of the mind?,"Chakras are real but they exist in subtle body and have corresponding points in physical body. Until you have an access to subtle body , chakras are imposition of mind.
How do you get access to subtle body?
One who attains state of no-mind can access subtle body hence the chakras. To attain state of no-mind you will have to meditate and keep your body pure. Meditation is optional but clean body is not.
99% of time chakras are mind game."
"While doing witness meditation how do I witness my thoughts? I'm really struggling with this. I totally identify myself with my thoughts whenever they come to my mind. I tried imagining them as bubbles, as words on a screen etc… it does not work.","Witnessing the thoughts is last in the row. There are three things you can witness.
The body senses the easiest one.
Emotions
Thoughts
Start with senses:-
Before sunrise, go to the park have 2–3 miles brisk walk.
Sit comfortably somewhere and close your eyes, just hear sounds for 20–30 minutes.
During day start to witness your emotions. Try to put off your reactions for 15 minutes and reflect on situation.
Once you comfortably can meditate for 45 minutes then start introducing thought witnessing.
Your mind will learn silence gradually."
"Will we ever know the science behind spiritual enlightenment? Can phenomena such as reincarnation, nondualism, Samadhi, Parinirvana or other spiritual/psychic abilities ever be subjected to the scientific method and explained by chemistry or physics?","We already know the science behind enlightenment. This is very simple to understand that brain can be reprogrammed or rewired.
Meditation is the only thing available to man higher than mind and it can help you go beyond the duality of our being.
The third (witnessing) brings surprise.
Just meditate by witnessing because witnessing is the seed of Samadhi, it is a bridge between conscious mind and awareness. When you will have completed 10000 hrs of meditation you will automatically attain Samadhi."
How do you define 'soul?',Soul is your true-self. Soul = Consciousness - conscious mind.
How does self-awareness differ from enlightenment?,"Self-awareness is created by conscious mind + awareness.
Self-awareness means presence, a continuous presence whatsoever you do or you don't do one thing is continuously in your conscious - you are.
The feeling of oneness that one is will create a centre, a centre silence, stillness. When energies are concentrated, crystallised then - a self is born.
One lives as loose bag as a false ego and we take it as self, there is no self.
By self-awareness, one becomes a crystallised self.
Whereas self-awareness leads to self-realisation.
The difference between self-realisation and enlightenment :-
What you know as ‘I' is mind's ‘I'.
There is false-self as an ‘EGO'. There is duality.There is subject and object also.
When duality of mind's ‘I’ dissolves - it is called self-realisation.
When dewdrop realises itself, it is self-realisation.
When existence merges into your being that is called enlightenment.
When Ocean merges into dewdrop it is called enlightenment.
There is false-self as mind’s ‘I’ or ego. There is duality."
"What are the connections between the level (conscious, pre-conscious, unconscious) and structure of the mind (Id, ego, superego)?","The conscious mind controls the voluntary functions e.g. I can consciously move my legs and hands. These are conscious actions. The conscious mind can do one thing at a time. It is single-tasking and logical.
The subconscious mind can do trillions of functions at the same time. It controls involuntary activities of the body like breathing, perspire, digest food etc.
The unconscious mind controls the body energy system and awareness.
Ego is a container of the inner self like skin and bones are outer container.
Ego is hard-wired unconscious responses which are part of your DNA. EGO is shifting sands. When you talk to your servant it is BOSS, when you talk to your boss it is SERVANT. It is variable in itself, there is no such thing superego."
What is a twin flame and spiritual journey?,"
Love has many manifestations.
Twin flame or soul mate is one of them. A twin flame (love) is the lowest rung of the spiritual ladder.
There are higher rungs of it. Next rung is prayer and devotion to God - surrender to higher power God's will and keep the faith you will be healed soon.
Yet another rung is search for Moksha, your true-self. All love and relations throw you back to the body but the Moksha will lead you beyond the body-mind and help you experience the ultimate where you become pure bliss and complete in your aloneness.
You don't need an outer reason to be blissful. Where you talk directly to your soul. Everything that is based on outer things or persons is momentary.
You can remain at the lowest rung of love for twin flame. It will always result in pain and sorrow.
You can treat the bad experience as a stepping stone to your spiritual growth, be thankful to one who loved you, gratitude is all you can give and move on.
There is a beautiful story about Buddha:-
When Buddha became enlightened, the first thing he did, he expressed his wish to meet Yashodhara, his wife….
His disciple, Ananda was a little bit disturbed, because how can a Buddha think about his wife? Buddhas are not expected to think that way.
When Buddha was alone, Ananda said to Buddha, ‘What will people think?’
Buddha said, ‘I have to express my gratitude to her, and I have to thank her for all the help she gave me. I will have to go.’
He went to the palace. He saw his wife. Yashodhara was mad! This man escaped one night without even saying anything to her. This man had escaped like a thief in the middle of the night – suddenly, without giving a single hint to her.
She said to Buddha, ‘why didn’t you trust me? You could have said that you wanted to go, and I would have been the last woman in the world to stop you.’ And she was crying. Buddha said “sorry” and he said, ‘It was out of non-understanding. I was ignorant, I was not aware. But now I am aware and I know – that’s why I have come back. You have helped me tremendously. I want to thank you for all the support you gave me. Forget those old things. Look at me! Something great has happened. I have come home. And I felt my first duty was towards you: to come, and to convey, and to share my experience with you.’
The anger is gone, the rage subsided, Yashodhara looked out through her tears. ‘Yes, this man has changed tremendously.’ This was not the same man she used to know. This was not the same man, not at all; this looked like a great luminosity… She could almost see the aura, a light around him. And he was so peaceful and so silent; he had almost disappeared. His presence was almost absence. And then, she forgot what she was doing – she fell at his feet and she asked to be initiated."
"Are all mammals wired for empathy, compassion, and grief?","Empathy, compassion and grief are present in all mammals with varying degrees subjected to other survival circumstances.
Let's take the “Triune Model” of the brain developed by Dr Paul MacLean. This model of the brain is based on three stages of evolution, the “Reptilian,” “Mammalian,” and “Cortex.”
Each stage represents a different type of mentality geared to the needs that prevailed at the time. Each is a separate computer with its special intelligence, subjectivity, sense of time, space and memory.
It is convenient to combine the first two parts ( reptilian and mammalian parts) and call it subconscious mind. Carl Jung has mentioned unconscious mind.
First four Chakras are rooted in the unconscious mind and response is rooted in subconscious mind. Three higher chakras are rooted in astral realms.
Humans have reptilian instincts that are why kundalini is represented as a serpent. It is very nature of most of the humans.Reptilian:-The reptilian brain is the brain stem. It stopped changing 250 million years ago. That is where the HARA chakra resides.
First three chakras are reptilian. It is involuntary, impulsive and compliance; it contains programmed responses that are rigid. This part of the brain is paranoid for self-prevention. Paranoia is useful for keeping an eye out for enemies or more to date for cars when crossing the street. This part of the brain doesn't learn from experiences. It is hard-wired and doesn't change. That is why hara chakra is very hard to open. The reptilian brain evolved for survival. The sex drive and urge to reproduce is a function of root chakra called mooladhar chakra. The second chakra is Hara chakra is connected to death. Flight response of the subconscious mind. People of suicide tendency can break free of hara chakra. The flight is the response of Hara chakra and fight is the response of solar plexus chakra (ego).
The mammalian brain has heart chakra and it has emotions and feelings. All mammals have motherhood. Reptilians are known to eat their eggs also. Mammal like a dolphin is emotional. Our subconscious mind is reptilian + Mammalian. The subconscious mind evolves its value system through emotions. Cortex is the third stage of development according to Carl Jung, it is about 40000 years old and still evolving. It is the conscious mind which has logic or reasoning that is what differentiates human from animals. Conscious mind evolves its value system through the rational interpretation of experience.
Because of the conscious part of the brain, we have three higher chakras - throat chakra, third eye and crown chakra. Throat chakra has given us language and music. The third eye is connected to the collective consciousness. Crown Chakra is connected to cosmic consciousness. All spiritual experiences happen because of the crown chakra.
These three chakras make a human connect to divine cosmic consciousness. Three chakras make human-divine because these chakras connect to astral realms."
"Are animal souls immoral? If that is so, then cats that were murdered by Brendon Solomon are roaming parkwest apartments in another body?","Animals and birds don't have souls. They are born as animals and birds and die like animals and birds.
Only humans have souls because human have special consciousness. After all, we have free will to become animal and divine also.
The lion is born as a lion and dies as a lion. Eagle is born as an eagle and dies as an eagle. They have a predefined map.
Only humans have possibilities to become divine or devil.
That is how we had divine souls like Jesus, Krishna and Buddha."
Is it true that Bruce Lee was spiritual and talked a lot about energy?,"Path of Moksha starts with the body and it is possible in a healthy body.
Bruce Lee was a modern-day monk who knew a lot about body energy that is how he could generate power in his punch equal to Mike Tyson's punch.
When he was injured and confined to chair he studied J. Krishnamurti and another Indian and international spiritual masters.
At end of his life, he turned spiritual studied spirituality."
How are dreams created in the brain? What purpose do they serve?,"Dreams are created on three levels- body, heart (emotions) and mind (psychological).
While sleeping if your body is thirty you will dream of drinking water.
If you are emotionally disturbed you will dream of people you miss.
If you desire something badly you will dream of that thing or person.
A dream is an essential part of sleep. Nobody sleeps full 8 hours it is swinging between dreaming and sleeping.
We enjoy dreaming not the sleeping because in sleeping we become unconscious.
In fact, psychologists say we don't sleep to sleep, we sleep to enjoy dreaming only. Dreaming is much like watching your favourite movie.
Dreaming is essential if you want to relax."
How do you heal from a negative soul tie?,"Love has many manifestations. Twin flame or soul mate is one of them.
A twin flame (love) is the lowest rung of the spiritual ladder.
There are higher rungs of it.Next rung is prayer and devotion to God - surrender to higher power God's will and keep the faith you will be healed soon.

His presence was almost absence. And then, in spite of herself, she forgot what she was doing – she fell at his feet and she asked to be initiated."
Are we twin flames?,"Twin flames is the name given to just another dependency. That is why it doesn't end our sufferings.
The truth is all that happens in the name of twin flames is like chasing a dream world.
No matter what name you give to the dance of sex it will remain the same old lowest level of human experience.
Whether it is soul mates or twin flame. It is a flame, a flame of desire, a desire to procreate at the lowest level.
And
Desires are the reason for suffering, desires need something or someone outside of you. Something or someone outside of you is not in your control, Tantra says until you find woman inside of yourself, your chase will continue, you can't be happy.
Every man is half woman and half man likewise every woman is half man and half woman because we are created by man and woman. You look out for a mirror image of inside woman, that is why you get attracted to a specific type of women.
The day you find woman inside of you, you will laugh about whatsoever you did in the name of twin flame or soulmate."
"Are we supposed to exist, or is it just an accident?","Life is a journey of the soul. It is neither accidental nor essential. Life is a quest.
A quest to find the meaning. We tend to find the meaning in thousand and one things.
Someone becomes an actor and he feels he is doing great things for society.
Someone becomes a doctor and he feels like he is God.
Someone becomes a poet and he feels he has found the meaning of life in the beauty of words.
But we keep reincarnating millions of times till we attain enlightenment - moksha.
Our journey ends the day we find our true-self."
Does Kundalini awakening end the mind's spacetime continuum?,"Time is concept of mind. There is no such thing as time. Mind is time, it keeps track of past as memories and prepares for the future because of desires.
There is only now everything else is mind's creation.
Time is an illusion as the mind is an illusion. That is why this world is called Maya.
Kundalini (awakening of third eye- sixth chakra) disassociates the illusive mind's perception about time and space but time and space continuum doesn't change"
Was Steve Jobs’ Kundalini awakened?,"Absolutely not, kundalini is awakened in healthy person only.
It is known to be active upwardly in someone who is overly sexual, who wants to make love to the whole existence. One, two or hundred of women are not enough for him. When sexual energies overflow then there is only one direction it can move that is ascending.
It doesn't get activated in an impotent or unhealthy body. Steve Jobs was suffering from cancer for a long time before death."
Why do my dreams sometimes occur when I'm half awake and half asleep?,"The half awake and half sleep is a state of dreaming and also known as alpha state of mind. This is also first stage of meditation.
This is very interesting that people long to slip into this stage of meditation and it is happening to you automatically.
Advanced stage of meditation is known as theta state of mind. Where you will have rare insights and intuitions while sleeping.
If you try to be aware of such dreams you will start to enjoy the joyride. This is first stage of astral travel."
"As we know that Brahma, Vishnu, and Maheshwar are representations of creation, protection, and destruction cycles, do they really exist as entities with a specific appearance?","People have lost the true meaning of Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh (Rudra). These are not God as we know in Photos and idols. They are symbolic existence of psychic knots in our bodies which can be untied to experience the divine- The laws of the highest cosmic plane where all manifestations are governed. These are granthis (psychic knots) in our subtle body which are governed by laws of the cosmic plane we know as God.
There are seven chakras in our subtle body and three granthis (psychic knots) — Brahma, Vishnu and Rudra (Mahesh).
Brahma knot is a combination of Muladhara Chakra and Svadhisthana chakra which is base of our existence connected to mother earth. Earth is our mother our creator. Muladhara is male and Svadhisthana is female.
When Muladhara Chakra meets Svadhisthana Chakra then energy is released for higher ascension.
Vishnu knot is combination of Manipura Chakra and Anahata (Anahata means unhurt) chakra which represents the heart. Our heart beats that is why we survive. It is a preserver. Manipura is male and Anahata is female.
Rudra(Mahesh) is a psychic knot is combination of Vishuddhi Chakra and third eye (Ajna Chakra) if it is opened then one is bound to open Sahasrara chakra.
Vishuddhi is male and Ajna Chakra is female.
When Vishuddhi Chakra meets Ajna Chakra then the third eye is opened and all the illusionary world of Maya is destroyed.
It is very difficult to open the third eye without the enlightened master.
The ego dies if the third eye is opened.
That is why Shiva is called the destroyer, destroyer of your mind's ‘I'.
7th Chakra is Sahasrara Chakra if it is opened then one attains Moksha. That is why all Hindu break open the skull on a funeral. This is just a shortcut.
People are not aware that by breaking the skull one is not liberated or one doesn't attain moksha. One has to open all three psychic knots and then on the opening of Sahasrara chakra one attains Moksha. When Mahavira got enlightened, he was called Nirgranthi - free of all three psychic Knots.
They do exist in the world of Maya and they are as real as any entity but by going beyond mind these appearances are just symbols.
We need these symbols because our mind works on symbols and signs."
What if one day you wake up from sleep and realise that your life was a dream?,"Whole life is a dream irrespective of the state of your consciousness.
Very few like Buddha, Mahavira and Krishna wake up from sleep and show us that there is a possibility to wake up from sleep.
This sleep is hypnotic and you remain either in a trance or in deep sleep.
You see a beautiful girl and unknowingly you start dreaming of making love to her. Is that real? No, but your stories feel real.
You go to watch a movie and you come out crying for pictures on curtain. Is that real?
So when are you awake? you are always planning and dreaming.
Remember you are fast asleep already."
"What is awareness? Becoming a witness - creating distance from body and mind, is this true understanding?","To understand awareness we need to understand consciousness.
What is consciousness?
Consciousness = ( Conscious) Mind + aware(ness).
Consciousness is where the mind's ‘I' and ‘you' exist. There are subject and object.
What is awareness?
Awareness is where subject and object do not exist. Awareness is pure consciousness.
Awareness = consciousness - conscious mind.
Witnessing is a bridge between awareness and conscious mind. Subject still exists in witnessing because it is doing.
What is the difference between observing and witnessing?
Observing goes outward, it is more like noticing actively.
Witnessing is inward, it is noticing passively.
What is a witness?
Witness happens as the culmination of witnessing. It happens once in a lifetime and then after one becomes a witness forever.
Witness appears and it never ends. This is called the state of samadhi.
Three states are waking, dreaming and sleeping. There is a fourth called - “turiya”.
Turiya has something of waking and something of sleeping. Sleeping not as we know. Sleeping means a state of no-mind.
Turiya is not state, it is true-nature of our being where awareness stands unpolluted of subject and object."
"What do Buddhist theologists make of the research involving meditating monks and MRI scans? Apparently spirituality is entirely a brain function. Does this mean that the Maya concept of ""all is illusion"" is in itself an illusion?","Hindu’s concept of Maya means a value-system that is wired into our brain.
And there is all the possibilities to replace that value-system with some higher value-system.
The destruction of value-system and replacement of new value-system takes place simultaneously.
Buddha provided that new value-system.
The human brain is fabulous in learning but enlightenment proves that the human brain is even better in unlearning.
In new value-system entity, ‘I' as the ego is lost hence the old value-system collapses like a castle of cards.
There isn't any other higher value-system available to humans than enlightenment hence Buddhist theology is ultimate."
Is enlightenment something we have to wait to the end of our earthly lives to enjoy?,"No, enlightenment is the divine version of your life. No doubt, it belongs to life beyond worldly life.
Whatsoever you know as life will have to disappear so that you live a life of bliss.
Man suffers because of desires and attachments. The attachments and desires throw you into past and future and the life is always here and now. Once you start to live in present, your life will have altogether a different fragrance.
That fragrance has divine alchemy to transform you and those who are around you.
Enlightened being carries his own milieus."
How do I find peace? My mind is never at peace. I overthink about everything. This makes me indecisive. There's one same thought on my mind always. What do I do?,"Mind is chaos, noise and commotion. Nothing can be done directly to mind because more you try more unrest you become.
You need something beyond mind, higher than mind so that mind can be controlled by the master.
Meditation is the only thing available to man higher than the mind. Only meditation can silence your mind.
Start meditating for 15 minutes in the morning.
Go to some park in wee hours of the morning (When everybody is sleeping then you don’t expect any phone call or disturbance)
Walk for 2–3 miles.
Then sit comfortably and witness the sound of the birds.
Gradually your mind will learn the silence."
"How can someone ascertain that what he/she experienced is just a delusion and hallucination, not a revelation from God?","There is only one revelation from God and that is enlightenment, everything else is delusion and hallucination.
And
When enlightenment happens then there is nothing left to be unsure about because God is an experience, not some person or power. Experience of Godliness is the answer to all your questions and If you experience God then no question can arise.
Godliness is experienced not only by you but all people around you. Even the birds and animals can feel it. You will have different shine in your eyes and those who have eyes can see it in very walk and talk of you.
Your voice will have the divine touch. Your smile will heal wounds of the thousand souls. Your touch will heal the deepest wound.
It will be like a piece of sky walking on the earth."
"Can we find such people in today’s life who are unaffected by worldly sorrows and pleasures? If yes, what is the way to attain this state of mind?","Certainly, there are people who live life unaffected by worldly sorrows and pleasures. The trick is not to identified with all that is called life.
Buddha says, “Life is sorrows, there is reasons for sorrow and solution is available to all humans.” The solution is enlightenment.
Root cause of the sorrows is desires and attachments.
Mainly there are two worldly attachments that we live with:-
Attachment to relationships.
Attachment to achievements (house, education degrees, car, gold and money).
Man is social animal but man is also free. He has a free will to become animal or divine.
If you live in lower urges then higher is impossible to reach. One has to forego lower to attain higher.
But people are satisfied with ready made answers and everybody has lost “WHY?” factor.
Nobody asks :-
Why am I born?
Why do people die?
Why do I have to live?
Why…………. This why we have lost in the mountains of answers we are provided with from our childhood.
Your question has that “Why” and the answer to your question is true-nature of everybody is unaffected by the sorrows and pleasures because our only karma is to live this life joyously. In fact, that is the only thing one attains on enlightenment."
Can ego be defined as one’s inability to ignore variables that are not in one's control?,"Ego is hard wired subconscious responses which are part of your DNA. EGO is shifting sands. When you talk to your servant it is BOSS, when you talk to your boss it is SERVANT. It is variable in itself, not the result of other variables. Ego is unconscious response."
"Which teachings of Buddha are the most relevant today, and why?","Every teaching of Buddha is timeless. But every teaching of Buddha is useless also. Your question is looking for relevance and path of the seeker is always a search for the ultimate truth, not relevance.
Relevance is the word of samsar and Buddha's path is of sanyas.
Buddha's teachings are meaningless today in your context."
"If a person is contemplating to take ""sanyas"", is he or she running away from the realities of life?","To find out answer to this we need to understand the meaning of sanyas. Sanyas means stepping out of the wheel of life. You may renounce everything but if you remain in everyday life the wheel of life (samsar) will keep moving you will not be able to remain pure in samsar.
If your seeking requires a conducive environment and you take sanyas then you are not renegade but if you are thinking or contemplating to take sanyas because of any other reason out of thousand and one reasons then you are a coward who is running away from the realities of life. Then it is going to be much like going for movie or picnic. It would be called spiritual entertainment."
It is said feeling is important in the law of attraction. Can we increase our feelings by consistently thinking of something?,"The law of attraction works on the tricking your subconscious mind by making it believe of something you want but you do not have.
Subconscious mind works in images and emotions, that is why we dream in pictures. But creating continuous suggestions by conscious mind we influence subconscious mind and the subconscious mind works with the existence to make it reality.
By visualizations , suggestions and affirmations we can definitely influence our subconscious mind to work as a genie in the bottle or Aladdin’s lamp."
Which is the most challenging aspect of making peace with your past?,"While working with many people on their spiritual growth I have come across one common challenge most of the people face while making peace with past is inability to forgive everybody including themselves.
But that is half the story. To make peace with past requires three dimensional work. One forgive everybody(past) two have gratitude for what you have (present) third have faith in God(future).
When you forgive everybody your heart purifies and gratitude becomes easy , gratitude prepares you for surrender to God's will. Trust in your God makes you live present fully."
How do Buddhists justify their meat eating habit?,"All the Buddhists all over the world have become non-vegetarians. How did it happen?
A little parable:-
Buddha had said to his bhikkhus – “Whatever is given to you in your begging bowl you have to eat it all. Don’t ask for more and don’t leave anything. Be respectful to food.”
Everybody knew that Gautam Buddha and his people were vegetarians, so only vegetarian food was given.
One day that one monk was coming back and some bird dropped a piece of meat in his bowl. Now a great problem arose for him because Buddha had said, “You should not eat meat, you should not kill for eating.”
He came to Buddha, and in front of the whole commune he asked the question, “What am I supposed to do? Should I throw this piece of meat away or should I eat it?”
Buddha closed his eyes and thought for a moment. It was really a difficult decision because there were dangers. If he says, “Throw it,” then he is giving an opportunity in the coming centuries for all the Buddhists to choose their food. Then whatsoever they like they will eat, and whatsoever they don’t like they will throw away.
That would reinforce choice and his whole teaching was based on choicelessness and desirelessness.
So he said, “Whatsoever is in your begging bowl, you have to eat it.”
There was no danger he thought, because birds will not do it every day –
That was the beginning of meat eating. That is how man’s cunning mind works. The monks started sending messages to the householders, “You can start giving meat; there is no harm.”
And finally, as time passed, all the Buddhists of the world have become meat eaters."
What is the point of having a dream if we don't remember it the next day?,"The dream is an essential part of sleep. Nobody sleeps full 8 hours it is swinging between dreaming and sleeping.
We enjoy dreaming not the sleeping because in sleeping we become unconscious.
In fact, psychologists say we don't sleep to sleep, we sleep to enjoy dreaming only. Dreaming is much like watching your favourite movie.
Dreaming is essential if you want to relax."
Can prayer and pilgrimage undo our bad karma?,"If you are talking about bad karma of previous birth then “Yes”.
If you are talking about the bad karma of this birth then the answer is “No”.
You will have to pay for bad karma you have done in this lifetime.
This is very simple to discern because your soul gets hurt when you hurt others or do bad karma. The wounds of the soul are not healed by prayer or pilgrimage.
You will have to perform balancing good karma so that your soul is healed."
What happens to human consciousness after death?,"When person dies then awareness (soul) returns to source(existence) and conscious mind remains around the dead body for 4–5 days or till the funeral. Within 13 days vibrations (conscious mind) take a jump and enters 28 hrs old womb.
What is consciousness?
conscious (mind) + aware (ness) = consciousness."
What would life be like without a soul?,"No human can exist without a soul. Only humans possess souls, not birds and animals.
The journey we know as life is a journey of the soul. The soul is eternal and because of soul, humans are reborn millions of time that is how human are reincarnated in different bodies."
Does the soul belong to some kind of dark energy?,"Soul belongs to awareness and awareness is pure energy, the fabric of the universe.
That means what you experience as a human is a shell of pure energy. That is why enlightenment is possible. Enlightenment is returning to source and source is soul - true-self.
The basic unit of cosmic energy is awareness.
This Universe is an expansion of energy and life is the crystallisation of this energy. What we see as matter is energy, what we experience as thought and consciousness is also energy. Everything is manifestation of same energy in infinite forms."
You have attained enlightenment. Why should we believe you and even follow you?,"You have to believe it because enlightenment is the only possibility beyond human comprehension.
This is very nature of the human mind to deny incomprehensible because this is how our ego gets its way to survive.
Surprisingly, you can taste the Enlightenment before you get enlightened by being in presence of enlightened being.
Even animals, birds and trees can feel the presence of the enlightened being because when awareness is born, it is born from the womb of the divine and it is like a piece of sky walking on earth.
If you are to believe make a trip to sit and meditate with enlightened being for a few minutes and if you can feel the enlightenment then there you too get closer to being enlightened.
Enlightenment is to be felt because mind (logic) and ego can't help you understand it. If you deny it you are closing the door to the divine possibility of your existence forever."
Can commenting on things online help open your throat chakra?,"Yes, if there is energy blockage at throat chakra then silence and using non-verbal means to communicate will open the throat chakra.
After the heart chakra opening your hands will have reiki qualities that means you can do self reiki or therapy.
Put your right hand on your forehead (third eye) and left hand on your heart chakra and follow the breathing for 10 minutes do it 2–4 times a day.
Keeping quiet is the best therapy for the throat chakra."
Is it okay to have alcohol and Marovana after Kundalini awakening?,"Absolutely not,
Alcohol or any other toxic chemicals or medicine will cause imbalance in apana and prana. The energy will flow downwards. This can cause serious damage to third eye and brain.
This can result in serious psychological problems.
For example :-
One of the email sent to me was seeking urgent help because person was only seeing the hudrends of furious dogs around him and he was so afraid that he was ready to come to me immediately.
When I asked him he told me that he was regularly having whiskey after kundalini awakening.
Then I asked him to discontinue the alcohol and start Chakra meditation.
Within 15 days he got fine.
Now he calls me rarely so I am sure he is fine that is why he doesn't call."
If we dream of bad things that happened in our childhood; is this the Brain trying to mend those wounds?,"This is Complex-PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder). Whatsoever happened bad in childhood is stored in the unconscious mind. Whenever season corresponds to the season of actual happening then whatever is stored in the unconscious is read by the subconscious and you see it as a dream.
How to solve it?
You have to be aware of the dream and 1) surrender to God, 2) keep the faith."
Do you know the Sushumna meditation? Would you recommend it?,"Surprisingly, there is only one meditation like there is one sleep but we have many dreams.
All thousand and one meditation(s) are just dreams or techniques.
Marcus Aurelius wrote book meditations. There is no equivalent word to Dhyan , only word that comes close to Dhyan is meditation (there is no such thing as meditations) in English.
The ultimate alchemy that happens on enlightenment has seeds in meditation. We have three states of mind - waking, dreaming and sleeping. Fourth is not state it is our nature called Turiya. Turiya has something of waking and something of sleeping. Sleeping not in the way we know. Sleeping means a state of no-mind. What we know as witnessing in meditation is the seed of Turiya. Once you attain the state of no-mind permanently- pure consciousness, all your questions become answers.
Witnessing is the only meditation and you can witness your breathing, your thoughts or your emotions. When you witness your thoughts, there will be gaps between the thoughts and when you keep meditating for years these gaps become larger and larger and one fine day one of the gaps will become permanent and you will enter a state of no-mind.
One step more you will enter Samadhi.
Turiya is permanent Samadhi."
How do heart chakra blockages affect your relationship with your soulmate?,"Absolutely yes, the heart chakra blockage makes you feelingless or stubborn on your irrational stands. You keep projecting yourself on others, you want people to see life from your point of view and your point of view is in the state of chaos.
What's the solution?
Forgiveness, forgive everybody (including yourself) or forgive your past and start living in now.
When you forgive everybody then your heart chakra and agya chakra is purified that allows your heart to be compassionate and then love flows from everywhere because you get what you give.
You will become a better human."
How does an empty mind work?,"There is nothing as such empty mind. Mind is chaos, noise or commotion.The mind is like a monkey it keeps jumping from one branch to other, it keeps planning and dreaming. It can't keep quiet even in sleep.
Opposite of mind is no-mind. We meditate to attain no-mind. Meditation is not concentration, mind is not contemplation.Meditation is witnessing. Witnessing our body, emotions and thoughts.
When you meditate by witnessing your thoughts, there are the gaps between thoughts and that is where meditation happens, if you keep meditating for years then one fine day one of the gap will become permanent and you will attain no-mind- mind emptied of contents."
"Is it true (what I was told) that If you truly loved God with all your heart, soul, mind and strength, You would desire with all your heart, soul, mind and strength to obey God (follow his commands and turn away from sin)?","Love has many manifestations.
Love for girl is same as love for God. Romantic love is lower rung of the spiritual ladder. That is why we have great love stories where lover sacrifices his life for love of lady.
Next higher rung is love for God , this love we know as devotion. Same thing happens in this love , devotee dissolves into God like Meera dissolved into Krishna.
Both love require surrender and trust only then transformation happens.
Highest rung of the spiritual ladder is search for moksha where enlightened master becomes your lover. Where you surrender your past to master and master takes responsibility of your future. All love throw you back to your body but love affair with master helps you transcend this body and mind. You attain Nirvana."
Do you believe in scientology and why?,"I have read lot about religious cults and two cults are very notoriously famous among the Americans:-
Scientology
You can read about it in A Piece of Blue Sky by Jon Atack,
2. Jehovah’s Witness
Leaving the Witness: Exiting a Religion and Finding a Life by Amber Scorah.
I have read many books/stories regarding the life in these cults and how they twist the teachings of Jesus.
Beware of any religious organisation it is like coming out of one prison and getting into other.
Any religion or ideology is prison. It is better to love your freedom and live life. Here are few things you might like:-
1) Live here and now.
2) Always choose positive emotions like forgiveness, compassion and gratitude.
3) Share positive things with people you love
It is worth living like free Antelope then caged Lion."
What if dreams are just us watching other versions of ourselves in a parallel universe? What are dreams?,"Dreams are ability of your mind to weave stories.
There are levels of reality (perceived by mind) as your waking state is also a dream so dreaming state is more unconscious state of your being and deep sleep is as unconscious as death.
Patanjali in Yoga Sutra says if one can go little deeper than deep sleep then he will reach Samadhi.
When you think you are waking then also you are in dream world that is why hindu say this world is Maya- illusion.
Deep sleep is just short of Samadhi. Samadhi is where you come out of dream and for the first time you experience reality without any prejudice.
This dream is as old as the earth and it is in your bone marrow. It is the nature of the dream that it can assume there is no dream and dream can create a dream out of dream.
When you look at the person you project dream on him. If you love him he will appear in one way and if you hate him he will be different. Dreaming mind creates thousands of worlds around it. Each man lives in his own world. Everybody has created a world around him and when two people fight then that is the fight between two worlds not the persons.
This mind is the lens one sees through and only awakened can see without the lens.
So there are no parallel worlds it is all in your mind and perceptions."
"A person pays a psychic for a black magic ritual. Who will get the bad karma back, the person that paid for the ritual or the psychic?","The psychic will get bad karma back, even if one is doing the white magic the psychic will get the karma back as bad as the sufferer has or will have."
What is the difference between bliss and nirvana?,"Nirvana means blowing out the flame, the flame of desires. It is a negative term but what remains after nirvana is bliss.
All our life we move in circles of desires and somewhere down inside we know it is frustrating but still one desire leads to another. The search for nirvana starts when one comes to know the futility of all this meaningless chase.
And
One attains (there is nothing to attain but the word is used because of the limitation of the language) nirvana - the total annihilation of desires - Blowing out the flame of desires."
How does sensation differ from perception?,"The sensation is related to heart and perception is related to the mind. The sensation is of intuition and perception is of the mind patterns/conditioning.
Sometimes I get a strong sensation as a result of intuition and most of the times it is true. Negative intuition can be felt like the thought of mind and positive intuition can be felt at heart."
What brings you peace and purpose?,"Peace and purpose are two diametrically opposite poles. If you look out for purpose then peace has to be forgotten.
Your peace is subjected to your ability to be desireless and just be in the moment, finding peace in doing small things and share positive things with people you love."
"Why my head moves sideways, forward and backward and sometimes clockwise, when I sit for silence after doing Shambhavi Mahamudra Isha. it is happening from few days. I am doing Shambhavi from past 2 years?","This is known as Kriya. The body sways shakes or shivers when kundalini starts to awaken.
You will move to adjust the ascension of kundalini. It is happening because kundalini wants to start an upward journey and it happens in the waxing phase of the MOON.
Your body is getting ready for the first meeting of the root chakra and Sacral Hara chakra. This will break first psychic knot known as Brahma Granthi, afterwards, it will move to next psychic knot known as Vishnu Granthi last psychic knot is Rudra (Shiva) it is when your third eye opens."
"Each year I grow two pigs and then I kill them humanely with a very sharp Katana samurai sword. They experience almost no suffering as I also train them to wear a blindfold. But I wondered, how long do they remain conscious after removing the head?","I wonder that you wonder after such a crime. But it is better to blame your shiny Katana Samurai Sword that way you can be held innocent.
But I must tell you they can sense your intentions in advance of days BEFORE you kill them the day you decide the date and time.
They remain conscious exactly 4 days or till you cook their heads."
Why have many Osho groups on Facebook disappeared?,"Oh yes! Alas! OSHO International Foundation is aggressive on copyright issues.
They are churning out lot of new titles by rehashing the old material and most of the new books are meaningless, confusing and without any logical flow. They are actually screwing the gems of Osho. Surprisingly they are modifying the matter also. Most of Osho’s new books {or rather Osho International Foundation’s book) are having Amazon BSR above One Hundred thousand that means they are selling less than a book per day.
They have lost vision of Osho. Now it is all about money, honey."
What if someone is mentally ill but is conscious? Does that mean he or she is possessed by jinns or is it a medical issue?,"It is certainly not a medical issue, it is a matter of unbalanced third chakras which controls the mind's ‘I' or ego.
Whenever there is energy blockage at second and third chakras then the survival response of the brain is not interpreted correctly by the body and that is why a person seems to be possessed by Jins or bad soul. Some take it as effects of black magic.
She will be fine you just have to take her to some enlightened master, he can get her right with one-touch and following by few sittings."
"Many years back, my guru had blessed and given a coin. Lately my sister taken that coin from my mom. They not even informed me. I politely asked to return it. She says she will return in a year from now. I feel cheated. What should I do?","This is how we create hell on earth and in fact, heaven and hell are on earth not somewhere in the sky.
The coin is just a device given to you to feel the presence of your Guru. Sooner or later you have to transcend that psychological attachment also.
You have to detach yourself from all good or bad in life so that you get attached to your true-self.
It is time to leave your Guru, this is the message existence is giving you."
Why does our logical mind almost stop functioning when hijacked by strong emotions?,"There are hardwired responses known as psychic knots. Tantra calls it chakras. When strong emotions take over it unbalances your third chakra called Manipura Chakra or Solar plexus that is why you feel like vomiting.
This chakra is related to your survival and in case of emotional death your third chakra starts burning your Prana (life force) and your brain gets very little of it hence your logical mind doesn't work.
Chakras are energy gates whenever there is crisis corresponding gate is opened and energy is released normally these gates are little open, not wide open."
What makes people want a healthy spiritual life while others don't?,"Sufferings, yes. As Buddha said , ""Life is a pain , there are reasons for that and there is possibility of transcending the pain and sorrows."" One who turns inward becomes spiritual otherwise people go on moving in circles outside. I met an old aquantance he was with a girl half of his age. I asked him, ""Who is she?"" He said, ""My fourth wife."" If he couldn't learn from 3 divorce that marriage is not for him when will he learn? People change religion just to find themselves in yet another prison.
People do thousand and one thing in the name of soulmate,twin flames and religions but they remain phoney and outward. The real liberation happens when one finds the one who is seeking - true-self."
"If I am able to overcome all my fears, will I finally achieve the realization of the Self and permanent awakening?","You can overcome all your fears only when you can actually feel the death that is why Aghori live in cemeteries. This is just first step towards awakening you just break the ‘fight or flight’ response by being one with death.
Then there are many other steps like foregoing your ego, forgiving everybody in your past and present ( including yourself), then there is love and compassion. Last one is killing your God.
To become divine (God) you have to kill your psychological God."
Are we as humans figments of God’s imagination?,"God is the result of human imagination. There is no God. God is a psychological need for humans. Animals don't have God, because they don't have such creative imagination.
If animals have God, how would it look like? Dogs will have God looking exactly like a dog, horses will have God looking exactly like a horse. That is why human God looks like humans only.
All our Gods are born out of our fear of death. There is no such thing as God."
Is Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev a Buddha?,"He is Buddha turned upside-down. Sidhartha became Buddha after his lavish life , after experiencing every aspect of life that is why he remained begger rest of his life after enlightenment. But Jaggi has become Sidhartha after enlightenment. Though his enlightenment and Buddha's enlightenment is the same but the person before enlightenment matters the most and that is why everybody's enlightenment is looked at differently."
There is something bothering me but I don't know if it happened while dreaming (nap) or if it was a thought. How can I know what it was?,"Certainly, it happened during the nap. Sometimes when you have a quick nap you slip into a deep sleep so quickly and your mind is shocked because of sudden disappearance it feels like a death.
Then it remains shocked for a long time till you have deep sleep for hours maybe 3–3 hours. This is something that typically resembles fear of the unknown (death). It happens at fight or flight response of the mind.
Your mind is at flight mode it needs rest.
Grab some Rum or wine and drink till you sleep.
You will be fine."
Why is a snake used to represent the Kundalini?,"Kundalini is called serpent because ascension of kundalini is like a serpent uncontrolled, uninformed and it stings like a serpent.
There are all the possibilities of going sex maniac to berserk. The release of energy is enormous and it can be uncontrollable and pure sexual."
How do you heal yourself during separation from your twin flame?,"Love has many manifestations. Twin flame is one of them.
A twin flame (love) is the lowest rung of the spiritual ladder.
There are higher rungs of it.
Next rung is prayer and devotion to God - surrender to higher power God's will and keep the faith you will be healed soon.
Yet another rung is search for Moksha, your true-self. All love and relations throw you back to the body but the Moksha will lead you beyond the body-mind and help you experience the ultimate where you become pure bliss and complete in your aloneness. You don't need an outer reason to be blissful. Where you talk directly to your soul.
Everything that is based on outer things or persons is momentary.
You can remain at lowest rung of love for twin flame. It will always result in pain and sorrow.
You can choose to be religious and pray God everyday then you will be more or less slave of yet another outer thing.
You are capable of transcending God also and reach your true-self, where you won’t depend on outer hooks to be yourself.
Search for your truth - the ultimate bliss."
How did Gautama Buddha get to know that he got enlightened? What is the criteria for that?,"In fact, Siddhartha realised there was nothing to attain. Everything is real only our mind's “I” is an illusion. Our ego is an illusion.
This is not about Buddha this is universal that happens to everybody who enters samadhi it doesn't matter who he is."
What are the benefits of interacting with your subconscious mind?,"The subconscious mind is a dictator, it is nearly hard to interact with it. It enforces his will because subconscious mind constitutes 92% of our brain and it is densely packed with the conditioning of childhood and our DNA.
The direct dialogue with the subconscious mind is impossible but yes it can be transformed with suggestions and stories.
Zen Masters use koans to deprogram the subconscious mind. Hypnosis is also an effective technique to reprogram subconscious mind."
Is it possible that the subconscious can communicate with other people’s subconscious?,"The value system of the subconscious mind is based on emotions and value system of the conscious mind is based on a rational interpretation of external experiences.
In the physical presence of the person, you generally communicate to subconscious mind by expressions and gestures. You might ignore it because we are too much entangled in our conscious mind always dreaming and planning. If you become little more alter you can read the subconscious mind of the person perfectly.
The subconscious mind communicates directly to the other's subconscious mind also. It is just a matter of being meditative and aware."
"When organisations of International significance like United Nations, World Economic Forum, etc. don't find it difficult to mention Sadhguru as Sadhguru, why certain section of media, (especially Tamilnadu) mention him as Jaggi Vasudev?","Sadhguru is a term used for someone who is enlightened and sharing his experience, not knowledge.
A pundit says scriptures are saying the right thing because it appeals to the logic, an enlightened one says scriptures are saying the right thing because that is his experience too.
There can be many Sadhguru, but one Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev."
"From the spiritual perspective, is our real self a watcher (of say a movie) or the witness (witness to the watcher)?",True-self is the watcher of witness. Witness still has subject in it but watcher doesn't have subject or object. Watcher is awareness where there is no ‘I'.
Does Kundalini Awakening happen when we come face to face with our twin flame or it happens when we see them first time through photos?,"Through photo, voice or description only mind works which is illusionary. When one comes in contact with twin flame face to face then something deeper than mind happens and the journey of souls starts.
You may miss it if you remain in your mind if you are grounded in your heart then your heart will know the moment you come in contact with your twin flame."
How do you know when your solar plexus chakra is awakening?,"Awakening of chakras never happens one by one, it happens in pairs.
When Muladhara chakra meets Svadhisthana then Brahma Granthi (psychic knot) is broken and energy rises to Manipura chakra (solar plexus).
While energy is stuck in Manipura chakra you will have digestion problems and kidney problems.
When Manipura (solar plexus) meets Anahata Chakra then the Vishnu Granthi is broken and energy rises to Vishuddhi Chakra. During this, you will have high blood pressure and increased heartbeats up to 160+.
If the passage is clear, which happens very rarely, then you might not have any symptoms."
"Due to my extreme interest in spirituality, I lost total interest in my studies (which is based on vain materialism). What should I do now?","What is spirituality?
Spirituality is not renunciation. Spirituality comes with indulgence. If you don't explore every aspect of life you won't be enlightened.
Spirituality comes after you have seen and experienced everything in life and now you are bored with everything like Siddhartha then you leave your castle and queens in search of the truth.
You are not ready to complete your studies and you think you are spiritual, you got the meaning wrong.
Renunciation is just a little part of it there is a lot of studies to be done before enlightenment.
When Bhakti, Dhyan and Gyan come together then enlightenment happens."
How did Lord Shiva get his third eye?,"Every human has third eye not only Shiva, but Shiva was first to realise that and formulate the meditation techniques to awaken the Seven chakras in human subtle body. That is how Vigyan Bhairav Tantra was born. Third eye is our spiritual eyes and center of spiritual body like Hara is our physical body CENTER. You too have third eye without third eye you can't sleep. Physical organ called pineal gland is right between two eyes and 2 inch inside between right and left brain.
Anyone can awaken third eye though it is arduous but quite possible.
Benefits of awakening third eye :-
Duality of life will end.
Crystal clear vision billions of High definition colours.
Crystal clear logic.
Crystal clear intuition .
You can literally see faraway stars and into the sky."
How much do we know about comas?,"As a mystic what I know if someone enters Samadhi without preparation his brain is damaged and now it is nearly impossible to return to a normal state.
What happens in Samadhi is totally understood by the mystics. The conscious mind is left behind and the unconscious mind from where all the body functions like heartbeats etc are operated keeps on working.
Sometimes if the brain is heeled one can return to a normal state otherwise it is unlikely that one can return from samadhi."
"How can we consider Dronacharya as an ideal Guru when he was lacking the basic moral judgement that made him to support the wrong, why there should be an award named after him?","Nothing succeeds like success. Morality is society's norm people can bend it whenever they see name and money.
Awards and ambitions are there to promote competition and in competition, the only winner is remembered there is no place for a loser with moral values hence you have to name it even if you name it ABC that won't have changed the nature of business."
What is inner pilgrimage?,"There are seven Holy pilgrimage places inside. If you reach seventh you reach your soul. You get a chance to meet God face to face.
Outer pilgrimages are superficial they are toys to play for your mind which needs everyday new things but the only place you will meet God is Sahasrara."
If Rishi Munis (great Yogis and sages) were able to control all their senses through intense meditation then why were they not able to control their anger?,"Yogic austerities can not make one enlightened and silence and compassion are attributes of an enlightened persons like Krishna, Buddha and Mahavira.
Rishi Munis were pious egoists because they used to perform Sadhana and rituals for years and that used to become their ego. They used to be in the pursuit of Sidhhis, which are again way of ego. Ego is disease and disease can’t be healthy.They used to be religious not spiritual.
Spirituality makes the person more human whereas religiousness makes one phony.
Enlightened beings are close to their true-nature which is the nature of every human being. True-nature or true-self is also known as soul."
Can enlightenment be achieved without any kind of special practice?,"Enlightenment doesn't happen till your mind is simplified, that is why it is called work of millions of birth. It requires oversimplified mind which requires one to gain knowledge by inference, direct cognition and reading words of the enlightened beings.
It is like changing gnome of you. It is specifically your achievement by experiencing non-achievement.
People befool others that it is your natural state but it is not. It is divine state of your being.
Enlightenment is your state of becoming one with the existence, going closer to God. Becoming God is the only purpose of being human.
God is not a person, it is the creative force of existence."
Why is it that you resist a particular experience after experiencing it without knowing why?,"If you have experienced something that stirred your fear of death or death of ego then your ego tries to avoid the same experience.
Both are related to fear of unknown. That is the reason one avoids same experience again without knowing why."
"If an empty mind is the devil's house, then why do people meditate?","There is nothing as such empty mind. Mind is chaos, noise or commotion.
The mind is like a monkey it keeps jumping from one branch to other, it keeps planning and dreaming. It can't keep quiet even in sleep.
Opposite of mind is no-mind. We meditate to attain no-mind. Meditation is not concentration, mind is not contemplation.
Meditation is witnessing. Witnessing our body, emotions and thoughts.
When you meditate by witnessing your thoughts, there are the gaps between thoughts and that is where meditation happens, if you keep meditating for years then one fine day one of the gap will become permanent and you will attain no-mind.
One step more you will attain samadhi."
Can your chakras or kundalini be somehow dissolved or deactivated by some guru forcefully? Is it possible?,"Kundalini can return to dormant state from heart chakra but if it crosses fourth chakra then it would be hard.
Master can help the kundalini reach third eye (which you can say he can dissolve) with just one touch at the third eye and in few weeks."
Is there something like tantric marriage through which we can make two people into one life?,"Finding your twin flame is the process of tantra because it involves kundalini.
Marriage is a social institution not spiritual. Twin flames and soulmates are spiritual or tantric union.
There is nothing we call tantric marriage."
"If Gautama Buddha is considered to be the ninth avatar of Vishnu, then why is Buddhism a separate religion from Hinduism?","Religions are stories and stories can have all the imagination running up and down, right and left.
You are never born twice and you never die once. Whether Vishnu or Buddha, they were humans like you and me. It is all construct of our mind that weaves such meaningless stories.
When Ernest Hemingway was asked about his clear writing style.
He said,
“The most essential gift for a good writer is a built-in, shockproof, shit detector. This is the writer’s radar and all great writers have had it.” - Ernest Hemingway
So to be a clear thinker one should always try to develop his ability to detect crap."
"I've noticed that strong concentration and visualization of childhood memories can temporarily pierce Vishnu knot, activate anahata and bring bliss. Is this a form of tantra and is it useful? Should Vishnu knot be pierced by prana or relaxed only?","If prana crosses Anahata Chakra then it will bring you sudden surge in energy levels , from throat chakra energy doesn't go back to lower chakras. You are still stuck at heart chakra. Visualisation of childhood shows that energy is comforting your heart chakra.
Forgiveness and let go purify your heart chakra and Agya chakra (third eye) and that is how all three chakras are awakened simultaneously."
Is it possible to have a thought that isn't influenced by something that is already existing?,"The mind is a chain of thoughts, it is impossible to have thought without subject and object. Sometimes object merges into the subject or vice-versa.
You have asked for something we know as the state of no-mind. From no-mind thoughts arise without subject and object.
But no-mind happens to a self-realized and enlightened person."
How different is the ego you slip back into after enlightenment compared to the one before enlightenment?,"Enlightenment doesn't happen till your mind is simplified, that is why it is called work of millions of birth.
It is like changing gnome of you. It is specifically your achievement by experiencing non-achievement.
People befool others that it is your natural state but it is not. It is divine state of your being.
Enlightenment is your state of becoming one with the existence, going closer to God.
Becoming God is the only purpose of being human and becoming ego of God is the only purpose we are born with.
So the ego of an Enlightened person is of God.
God is not a person, it is the creative force of existence."
Krishna in Gita says that anger is harmful & leads to veiling of judgement. (Bhagavad Gita 2.63). But he himself is not able to control anger & attack Bhishma with chariot wheel. How can we follow Krishna's words when he himself don't follow them?,"You needn't follow anyone. Just follow yourself.
Remember whatsoever is done unconsciously is a sin and your anger become beautiful when it is conscious.
When a mother tells her kid not to go on the street even though she is angry but her anger has the beauty of love and care.
Being unconscious is the only sin one can commit."
How do you differentiate between a spiritual experience and a mental disorder or delusion?,"Every spiritual experience is the result of extreme mental disorder.
Most of the spiritual experiences happen at three dimensions - sleeping (unconscious), dreaming and waking.
Spiritual experiences that happen in the first two states are not noticeable.
But at the third level spiritual experience, they become pretty clear because they happen when energy hits the third eye.
At third eye one jumps out of States of mind and acquire fourth, Hindu call it Turiya or Samadhi.
The whole ego constructs and belief system collapse and you are renewed as fresh as new birth but below the third eye everything is a more or less mental disorder."
What is the correct and righteous way of leaving a guru?,"Hate him from the bottom of your heart.
You have to be detached from Guru to get attached to God. Then you have to break free of God too.
Buddha said, “ If you meet Buddha on the street, just kill him.” God is the imagination (Maya) and until you destroy that you won't break out of illusion (Maya). God is a subtle hook of Maya.
Path of devotion is full of imaginations. If you continuously go on insisting on a certain hypothetical concept of God, one day you will see that hypothesis becoming a reality. Christian can't see Krishna. Mohammedan can't see Jesus and likewise Hindu can't see Jesus.
They all can see what they believe in what is their hypothesis. God is nothing but pure imagination. Very few people are able to drop that and very few people become enlightened. That is how Bhakti Marg works, you drop the last rope which is keeping you clinging to illusionary world called Maya. Destroy the idol of God. This is the last step to liberation. The only hook remaining this is where most people fail.
Ramakrishna was a great devotee, and the path of devotion is full of imagination. Ramakrishna was a devotee of the Mother Goddess of Calcutta. An enlightened man, Totapuri, was just passing by. He looked at Ramakrishna and he felt great compassion for the fellow. He told Ramakrishna: “You think that you have experienced the Mother Goddess.”
Ramakrishna said: “See, I have talked with her, and not one day, but every day.” He was an honest man, and what he was saying was true.
Totapuri laughed and he said: “Listen, that Mother Goddess is nothing but pure imagination. Unless you drop that you will never become enlightened. So sit down. I will remain here for three or four days, just for you. I have to help you in somehow dropping the Mother Goddess.”
Now that was a very difficult matter. Ramakrishna had loved the Mother Goddess his whole life, danced before her. He used to prepare food for her, He used to fight with the Mother Goddess. And he was not a traditional fellow; he was very untraditional, very loving, very innocent. His imagination of Mother Goddess was so real. Nobody could understand him.
Totapuri said to Ramakrishna: “You sit in silence. You don’t have any other ropes (hooks) that I can see, just this one rope. So when you see the Mother Goddess arising in your imagination, just take the sword and cut the mother in two pieces. They will fall, and with them will fall the last barrier.”
Ramakrishna said: “From where am I going to get the sword?” Totapuri said: “From where have you got this Mother Goddess? — From the same place. It is your imagination. That is also your imagination; only imagination is needed to cut imagination.” It took three days, because he would go into meditation and the Mother Goddess would be standing there, and he would forget all about Totapuri. He would forget all about the sword, and tears would star flowing from his eyes, and Totapuri would shake him saying: “What are you doing?”
Ramakrishna said: “What to do? — Because once I see her, she is so beautiful…. Don’t force me to cut her.” Totapuri said: “Listen, I can see even from the outside: your face immediately changes when you see the mother. I have brought a piece of glass, and the moment I see that you are seeing the mother — because your tears start flowing, your face becomes so beautiful — I will make the cut on your third eye centre with the glass. I have to do this because tomorrow I leave. I cannot waste any more time. This is the last chance: either you do it or I am finished with you.” And Totapuri said: “When I cut your forehead and blood starts flowing, don’t hesitate, just take the sword and cut the mother.” Ramakrishna cut the mother and he remained silent for six days.
Totapuri remained for six days, and when Ramakrishna opened his eyes he thanked Totapuri and said: “If you had not come, I would have lived my whole life with the hallucination. My last barrier has fallen away.” Ramakrishna became enlightened after he had cut the last barrier.
I say, “If you have finally to cut it, why start it in the beginning?” You may be very close to enlightenment. It might take time but it is possible if you can kill God in your imagination by your imagination. The meaning of Ganesha Chaturthi is exactly the same.
What I say on Dhyan Marg, let’s start with removing last hurdle i.e. God and understand life - Gyan Marg. You just need to meditate (Dhyan) and understand life (Gyan) . No prayer, No God is required. Your last pain will be the first step. Because in beginning you are strong enough to change beliefs easily. There is no God. In fact, neither there was God nor there will be.
If you can't deny God, at least start to doubt its existence. If you start to question its existence then your inquiry will go deeper into more existential questions. Your questions will have different quality. The fictional framework of mind will collapse and enormous energy will be released and will be available to other activities of the brain like logic, meditation and creativity. You will become more insightful. You will look at the world with a different point of view. Your question - “ Who am I? “ and “ Does God exist? “ will have a different direction.
When people ask me, “Which is the most important quality of human for enlightenment?” I tell them your ability to use imagination for a purpose. It can become a weakness and cause of sufferings. It can also become strength to attain enlightenment.
Same energy only direction is opposite. When Friedrich Nietzsche says, “God is Dead.” and When I say, “There is no God.” It is different. First of all, there has never been God, the statement - “God is dead.” becomes false. When I say, “There is no God.” I say it from my experience, from my realization. If there is God then that is inside of you and nowhere else, because God is experience of your true-self."
Why do people not want to be a monk?,"Being monk is quality and the becoming monk is repression.
People keep running away from life, some become monks, some become yogis. Some go to monastery, some go to Himalaya.
What is inside of them, they keep avoiding? Some know it as God, some know it as true-self, yet some people call it enlightenment.
Truth is inside. There is nowhere to go but in."
What is ego? What is the importance and necessity of ego in life?,"Much like our body ego is inner construct. Your body gives physical boundary and ego gives mental boundary.
Ego is not constant phenomena it is shifting sands.
When your are with your wife or lover it is different , when with opponent it is different.
When with your servant it is boss and when with your boss it is servant.
Here is list of layers :-
Layer one : In this people live artificial life like if they go to funeral they cry with others but their tears mean nothing. They say Hello but to avoid people. Frederick S. Perls has called this layer CHICKENSHIT.
Layer two : This layer is pure ego. It is like - I AM PRESIDENT OF AMERICA. I AM HUSBAND OF MISS UNIVERSE. People in this layer are bit better than layer one but dangerous because they become politicians, police officers etc. Frederick S. Perls has called this layer BULLSHIT.
Layer three: When something bad happens in layer two like death of loved one or divorce then people like poets, authors, musicians, lyricists or people good at heart fall to third layer. This layer is called CHAOS. Here people either become alcoholic or druggist or go back to layer two.If one remains meditative and aware then he enters next layer.
Deeper layers of ego throw you close to true-self."
How can you describe the toxic world of self-help gurus?,"Self-help gurus are as confused and disturbed as their readers that is why they keep cranking out new books.
Every week new flavour. What they seem to miss that they harm people by telling them something they think life is.
Recently bestseller - “ Think like a Monk” was authored by a failed monk. But he looks very artificial while bragging about his life as a monk. Monks are taught to silence their mind, not to think.
Self-help gurus are as pathless as anybody who's reading them."
Why do people like Lalu Yadav have a strong presence in Bihar? Is it because Mahavira and Buddha were so successful there?,"Buddha and Mahavira no doubt touched the peaks of human consciousness.
They were successful in the spiritual world. No other person could reach those peaks in recent human history.
Whereas Lalu is concerned, he is funny and straight despite of all his shenanigans he is popular and his presence does scare opponents."

"Is enlightenment or the spiritual path a result of brain wash of ignoring the dark side of one's life? Is it necessary to ignore tough situation, can't it be solved?","Spiritual path is about dropping character, being fluid and live here and now. Character is closed vessel , it is automatic, it needs feedback from other.
Live as a witness without any this or that beyond duality of life.
Enlightenment is brainwash. Washing your brain of all the conditioning of religion, society and education."
Does spiritual knowledge make you unemotional?,"Spiritual knowledge makes you confused, egoistic and know-it-all.
But spiritual experience makes you more human.
It fills you with compassion for everybody. It throws you closer to your true-self.
It gives you balanced life, you start to live by heart not mind."
Does meditation make you lazy and unproductive?,"Meditation is a alpha state of mind it relaxes and spares energy with that spared energy you become active.
Many people complain the sudden increase in libido after few weeks of meditation.
There are deeper states of mind like Theta state, it will make you more insightful. Your intuition will have new heights.
Meditation is the solution to all the mind related problem."
"I’m schizophrenic. How do I meditate? When I close my eyes, there are pictures. What do I do with them?","This is a lack of concentration. You need to practise concentration before you start to meditate.
Chakra meditation will help you organise your brain as it uses all the faculties of our brain.
Chakra meditation uses shapes and colours, touch (mudras) and sound literally it works multidimensionally.
You can switch to normal meditation after a few months of chakra meditation."
"After watching something about Annabelle, I feel negative energy or supernatural energy. Is it my fear or real something is there?","It is nothing but fear of death. All fear are fear of death.
Life is duality where everything has opposite side.
We have day and night, sadness and happiness, love and hate and God and devils or demons.
Every negative side is face of death and positive side is face of life.
If you understand the death you will be able to enjoy life truly.
If you understand ego (negative emotions) you will start to love.
Love dissolves every fear, let center of your life be love.
Sleep God is there to help you."
What is the introductory specialty of a spiritual relationship?,"G.o. t.o. hell. This is the only message that will put you on the path of seeking.
Love is beautiful but not all love are great. Humans are prone to very subtle ego problems.
Love is divine but now how many of you know of that.
.00099%
Just check out does your wife love you without your wallet?
Why did your last love leave you?
There is only one thing you should love that is yourself not anything else."
"Do I really need a guru in physical form to attain samadhi? If yes, how can I find mine?","No, you don't but it helps to have one in final stages just before Samadhi.
As the brain is rewired many times after Samadhi, Guru can make your journey easier because he has already travelled the path if he is enlightened.
Samadhi is the start of a new life, it is not the end.
The presence of Guru will benefit you like a catalyst.
You will soar higher and higher within few years maybe 2–3 years and the joy of being with pure consciousness will fill your being like a light from the sky.
But it will be purely optional as an enlightened master like Buddha is hard to find.
There is a beautiful parable about Buddha. When Buddha attained samadhi. He didn't come out of it for seven days. All the devatas (Gods) gathered at his feet and requested Buddha not to remain silent. They said , “ So many people for lifetimes wait for someone to become a Buddha and deliver the message after coming back from samadhi, to speak and tell what he has known. Please speak.”
But Buddha said, “ There is no one left here to speak , there is no desire left to speak. Moreover what I have witnessed- it is hard for me to believe that it can be spoken and where is the chance of listeners understanding it?”
When Gods didnt agree, Buddha said, “I will speak; but these things that I may say to somebody , I myself would not have understood had someone else told me before my own realisation. So how would anybody else understand? Through my experience of Samadhi I have come to one more conclusion , that those who will be able to understand what I have to say can also reach without me; and those who would not be able to understand what I have to say- there is no sense in racking one's brain in front of them.”"
How do you shield from outside negative energy?,"By expanding your Aura you can help others because it is not about protecting yourself from negative energies.
Focus on the positive aspect of your being.
Send some positive vibes you will be amazed how it will come back to you.
Here are the steps:-
Share positive things with people.
Turn your negative emotions into positive by practising compassion, gratitude and forgiveness.
Live here and now.
You are the world, the world is not you."
"How can I get rid of my focus in breath? When I try to get rid of it, I have a fear then who will take care of it? And that's why I can't focus any where? I am just stuck in this situation please please God's sake help me.","This is the problem of Agya Chakra. Probably your pineal gland is calcified and it is causing lack of general awareness.
To decalcify the pineal gland, you will need to make changes to diet.
You can try this:-
Just sit comfortably and focus on breathing but visualise your God - Shiva or Krishna ( any Blue God, because Agya Chakra responds to blue colour - the colour of the sky).
Put right hand's palm on your forehead and left hand's palm at heart.
Keep repeating Shiva is there to take care of me (suggestion).
When your mind calms down then remove your focus to outer sounds and keep it there as long as you feel comfortable.
PS: Agya Chakra is the seat of your God."
I am 23 years old and I want to go deeper into spirituality. How do I ensure that I don't go crazy in this process?,"
You want to have cake and eat it too.
Forget going crazy.
Spirituality is about dying and resurrection.
You will have to live death before you come to new life.
Eat, sleep and drink.
You can’t have honey without flies.

Is it possible for a meditator to be compassionless? Are meditations and compassion not related?,"Absolutely no.
You are trying to embrace the diametrically opposite poles.
Can you love your daughter and keep planning to kill her.
The answer is flat ‘no'.
Compassion is our nature."
How do you know if you're enlightened?,"Enlightenment is not a certified course. Enlightenment is a whole new life in itself.
Enlightenment is not something you can miss noticing, it is something felt by the people around you.
Those who have eyes will see it in your eyes, in your walk and talk.
Silence will surround you. Even birds and animals can notice the presence of an enlightened being.
It is like a piece of sky that is walking on the earth.
The answer is in your very question."
How is reality not what it is not?,"If you can touch it is reality, if you can see and eat it is reality, if you can throw it is reality.
Everything else is reality, but on your plane of mind.
Reality is not what you know as truth, it is always beyond what you know."
Is Samadhi the same as emptiness?,"Samadhi is the total annihilation of mind (as master), what remains in samadhi is emptiness.
The mind is noise, chaos or filler of consciousness, emptiness is awareness aka pure consciousness.
During Samadhi (which happens for a few days to few weeks), the brain is rewired for a higher level of consciousness called superconsciousness."
Is a Kundalini awakened person also an enlightened one? How are they related?,"Yes, absolutely.
Buddha and Mahavira never talked about chakras and kundalini. It is not because they didn't have kundalini awakened rather their passage was so clear that they didn't feel any chakras. One feels chakras if there is blockage. Osho talked about kundalini and chakras extensively (he himself went through Anahata chakra blockage - also called “dark night of the soul”). Osho invented many meditations to awaken kundalini.
Kundalini is awakened with an explosion and all 7 chakras open and remain open forever when one becomes enlightened."
Which is the most powerful chakra?,"The mind is the chaos, noise and root of all health problems. Mind resides in Agya Chakra and your God also resides in Agya Chakra.
If your heart chakra and Agya Chakra is balanced then all your body is healed.
Prayer and Forgiveness purify your heart chakra and Agya chakra. You will have to forgive everybody (including yourself) to balance both the chakra."
Does time heal all wounds?,"Time doesn't heal wounds rather mind is time. Memories are something that is already dead but mind lingers on to memories.
Life is only here and now, past and future are in your mind.
When you start to live in now then your wounds disappear automatically."
How can I fall asleep at will?,"Death and sleep have similarity. Both have three stages ;-
Stage 1 : Lie down comfortably and relax your body by pull in (negative force/strength) all your energy from body.
Stage 2: Relax your breath. Deep inside, the breath contains the prana, and that’s why you die when the breath stops. The breath keeps us connected to the body.
Stage 3: Relax your mind by focusing on the gaps between inhale and exhale, exhale and inhale. Your thoughts will start to disappear and within few minutes you will enter dreaming and then deep sleep."
"Will meditation help me be happy, have high self-esteem and confidence, smarter, help me love and over make life clearer and better in every way?","Meditation can help you achieve all of the above with one condition.
You should be able to love yourself without all of the above.
Meditation happens to those who can love and what happens in love also happens in meditation.
Meditation is easier than love as other is not required.
Meditation and love move in the same dimension.
Only love can simplify your mind otherwise mind is chaos, noise or commotion.
It is not easy to sit quietly for 5 minutes.
A meditator has to be a lover first.
I am not talking about sex, I am talking about love. People misunderstand love and they know sex as love.
If sex is born out of love then sex becomes prayer or meditation.
That is how Tantric sex was born. Tantra considers sex as a meditation.
Let it be clear, you need to fall in love with yourself, your world before you start journey of meditation otherwise you will be concentrating or contemplating."
Why is spiritual truth so elusive?,"Spiritual truth is elusive because we are conditioned by society and religion.
All the education system and society try to condition you so that you serve them.
Nexus of politicians and priests exploits your conditioning to rule you.
Politicians say die for country.
Priests say die for religion.
And there are few poor who die for girls.
Nobody is interested in your growth. Everything is oriented outwardly, nothing is oriented inward.
No need to die for anything. Become selfish and start your journey to know your truth.
The day you will become real selfish you will find your true-self."
Meditating for some time but my third eye chakra is getting all the focus and not other chakra even when I focus it some where else.2 times something burst in my forehead and I saw a bright light.Why is my 3rd eye reacting in place of muldhara?,"Until you can feel the vibrations at Muladhara Chakra ( located between the perineum and the coccyx or the pelvic bone), everything is imagery - games of the mind.
The third eye can't be activated directly. It requires at least two lower chakras activated (Muladhara Chakra and Heart Chakra).
Agya Chakra is activated when you forgive everybody in your life (including yourself) or when you can understand the message of Jesus.
Forgiveness purifies your heart chakra and agya (third eye) chakra and in the deep silence of let go Agya chakra is activated.
Symptoms;-
When Agya Chakra is activated then all of sudden your world changes as your vision becomes HD and eyesight becomes super clear now you can see very far away into the sky and stars.
It will happen on full moon night (most probably)."
What is the nature of the soul?,"What is the soul?
What we call soul is true-self-nature of every human being. Only humans have soul, not animals and birds.
or
You can say the soul is our true self.
What is true-self like?
True-self remains intact from our desires and attachments. It is like the sky and clouds are our ambitions and desires.
True-self is unclouded and always full of compassion.
Gurdjieff used to say that not all humans have a soul. I guess he meant to say so that we come in this world and die like an animal of desires, not knowing our true-self.
The moment you know your true-self, your soul is born."
"If there's no 'I' to feed, protect. and satisfy and everything unfolds exactly as it's supposed to, why do enlightened beings go to work, write on Quora or do anything purposeful? Why do they go for preventative health care visits or to the dentist?","Your question has roots in misunderstanding of Enlightenment.
Enlightenment simply means - I know myself (true-self).
The enlightened person stops identifying with ‘I' as an ego.
Enlightenment is an inner journey and outside world remains the same.
There is a choice of an enlightened being to be Arhat or Bodhisattva.
Arhat enjoys his aloneness and remains silent. Arhats are considered a bit selfish. These are called Theravada Buddhists.
Bodhisattva goes out and helps others to reach enlightenment out of compassion. These are called Mahayana Buddhists. Bodhisattva is an ideal which spiritual seekers aim for in order to achieve Buddhahood.
You notice only Bodhisattva and Arhats are not noticeable.
Next time watch out to spot Arhat and you will find more Arhats than Bodhisattva."
"When I was meditating I accidentally woke up in mid meditation but I wasn’t awake physically. my brain felt like it sparking like a fuse, it was difficult to move and my neck was so stiff. why did this happen?","Congratulations, you have touched your unconscious mind.
Your conscious mind and unconscious mind separated.
You had a glimpse of pure awareness.
You have just witnessed waking-sleep.
Let it happen. Your journey of inner world has started"
"What is the title of one who is specifically NOT seeking Enlightenment? (E.g. bodhisattva is one who has it, but delays Nirvana to help others. What is the title for one who actively does not seek enlightenment?)","Enlightenment happens when you are done with ‘seeking'. Seeking has to start and at one point of time, it has to end.
Buddha attained enlightenment the night his seeking ended.
Desirelessness happens when your desire to be enlightened is gone and enlightenment happens when the last desire to be desireless is also gone.
The title for one who doesn't seek is BUDDHA."
How do I know If I am ready for my kundalini awakening?,"Tap your left foot, if you feel the beat at end of your spine, you are ready.
If you enjoy dancing alone with beats you are ready.
If you flow with songs, you are ready.
If you contemplate beauty of full moon, you are ready.
If you have become choiceless, you are ready.
Kundalini loves music, dance and full moon."
Do desires/wants automatically come into existence or do humans consciously bring them into existence?,"Desires or wants are artificial but the urge underneath every desire is part and parcel of our basic needs.
You are hungry - you need food but if you want Pizza with truffle cheese topping - this is desire.
Your body needs sex - this is need - you want Dani Daniels - this is desire.
Basic needs are limited but desires are unlimited."
Does meditation make you a nicer person?,"Morality and meditation have no relation. Morality is social conduct and meditation is spiritual practice.
In fact, meditation turns you into inhuman in initial stages.
When you meditate then the energy is spared and that residue energy turns into sexual energy because the body knows only one language of hunger.
One starts to become sexually overactive and he/she can only see sex in everywhere. One might become a porn addict and start to masturbate heavily.
I get many questions regarding sexual urges. Especially women are more prone to such energy overflow when they start meditating.
When meditation starts to happen one has to be very alert and aware of his thoughts and without proper guidance, meditation can harm the character of the meditator.
For example, if one is meditating and he also wants to enjoy alcohol. Then he will turn into a sex maniac."
How are we all one consciousness?,"There is cosmic consciousness which governs the laws of the Universe.
There is individual consciousness (every creature has it) which is primarily connected to cosmic consciousness.
Individual consciousness is part of cosmic consciousness. Not just living being even rocks and trees are also part of that cosmic consciousness. Everything is at a different level of consciousness,
Every molecule and atom has to follow the laws of cosmic consciousness. That is how we all are connected to each other.
Take a look at following;-

Cosmic consciousness is at top of the ladder and this is what we know as God.
The very fabric of the universe is awareness and awareness is the same energy at the core of it which this universe is made up of.
The universe is an expansion of energy and life is the crystallization of the same energy. Matter or consciousness all is the transformation of the same energy, hence follow the same cosmic laws."
"Can you practice yoga without embracing it as a religion or faith in Eastern mysticism, or just as an innocent exercise?","Yes, but primarily yoga is the path to self-realization.
Without eastern mysticism, yoga is as good as Tabata, Aerobics or Callisthenics.
I bet you will have better results with other forms of workouts than yoga.
Yoga is good for someone who hasn't done any kind of workout all his/her life and now he is too old to work out.
There are other dangers of yoga - you might provoke Kundalini spontaneously.
Yoga is meant for Kundalini Awakening.
You can check out side-effects of kundalini awakening online.
Go for strength training and cardio."
"I’m done with ‘seeking liberation’, which happens to very few, if any. Can you reveal the radical secret about enlightenment, once and for all?","Enlightenment happens when you are done with ‘seeking'. Seeking has to start and at one point of time, it has to end.
Buddha attained enlightenment the night his seeking ended.
Desirelessness happens when your desire to be enlightened is gone and enlightenment happens when the last desire to be desireless is also gone.
If you go and attend Satsangs or guided meditation and that is too online then I bet you are still the same animal of desire.
There is nothing one can get from online guided meditation and Satsungs because the presence of enlightened being is only blessing one can be benefited from on the path of seeking."
"Buddha taught transcendence of all compounded conceptual frameworks including the conception of transcendence, creator Allah, paradise, etc. On the basis of Quran can it be inferred that Buddha was misguided?","In fact, there is no paradise. Buddha was the most intelligent person who ever lived on the earth. He denied God and soul and accepted reincarnation. It was a hoax.
There is nothing we know as God. There is nothing we need from religion. Life is when you are, there is nothing you need.
Live here and now."
"According to Christianity, why Lord Jesus didn't give us any knowledge of our subconscious mind in the 'Bible' when our life is completely depends on our subconscious mind?","Simply he didn't know it. Do you think there is anybody else beyond Lord Shiva.
Do you know Lord Shiva invented 7 Chakras and readjusted in this alien body of ours to make this beautiful place called earth our home?
Bible, Quran and Gita are nothing but experience of your true-self."
"What am I to make out of it - Himalayan monk Om Swami charges Rs.10,000+ for a course on Visnu Sahashranama, is it not a bit too materialistic?","There is nothing Om Swami can give. Don't you think self-realization is the personal quest?
I wonder if you don't go to a temple, mosque or gurudwara. Go there and find peace.
God is there for you."
"Assuming the sight of lifeless body parts triggers spiritual awakening (as practised by Aghoris), why is it not happening to butchers or doctors?","Aghoris live death by being close to dead bodies. They feel the mortality of the body.
Enlightenment is the death of the ego. Technically it is a psychological death. One who is not only fearless about death but also who is in love with death is capable of attaining spiritual awakening.
Doctors and Butchers behave like a God. They have a very subtle ego. They decide who will see another day. They play God.
Enlightenment is the state of egolessnesss.
For Aghoris, death is a ritual for rebirth and for doctors and butchers, death is the end."
"Are time, space, and causation very petty concepts to understand the universe and nature of reality?","Time is a concept of mind. There is no such thing as time. Past and future exist in mind only. There is only NOW, the past and future are nowhere.
Cause and effect (causation) and duality are also hardwired in our mind they are not part of reality.
According to Einstein's relativity - time is the fourth dimension of space.
Space is always there, the same. It is the same sky, it is the same space: things in it may change but space remains unchanging. And if time is also a dimension of space that means it does not change at all.
You are born, grow young and old, time doesn't change it is just a reflection of our mind.
To understand the universe you need to understand energy because the universe is the expansion of energy and life is the crystallisation of that energy.
What we see as matter is also energy. What is felt as consciousness is also the transformation of energy. The whole cosmos is a manifestation of the same energy in infinite forms."
What is a type of meditation that will get me great results very quickly?,"Don't make a goal of meditation. If you make a goal of getting results then your ego will make it ambition and you will struggle to meditate, you will be frustrated.
Meditation is non-doing. Doing is a way of moving out. Non-doing is a way of moving into the centre of your being.
The trick to meditate is to become an observer of the mind. Meditation starts by being separate from the mind, by being a witness of the mind. e.g. When you look at the mirror, you will only see your face if there is a distance between your face and mirror, if the mirror is too close to your face you won't be able to see your face. Likewise when you become observer/witness of mind then a gap is created between mind and witness/observer/watcher.
Watching is the key to meditation. Watch your mind. Don’t do anything – no repetition of a mantra, no repetition of the name of god- As you watch, slowly mind becomes empty of thoughts; but you are not falling asleep, you are becoming more alert, more aware.
As the mind becomes completely empty. Just by watching, you immediately get out of the mind.
While witnessing there will be gaps between thoughts and as you keep meditating these gaps will become larger and larger and one fine day one of the gaps will become permanent - you will enter a state of no-mind.
One step more you will take a quantum leap into Samadhi - Turiya."
Does every question have a spiritual answer?,"Your every question arises out of spirituality thus every question has spiritual answer and all other answers are false and short-lived. Life moves in circles so everything goes to where it has come from.
Your being is eternal that is why you merge into eternity. Every question may not be spiritual but every question has spiritual answer."
"What does ""Emptiness is a quality of all phenomena.” mean? (The Dalai Lama). Can anyone make sense of this; it reminds me of psychologist Carl Jung saying, “the primary problem of man is emptiness.” Can you reconcile these assertions?","Everything is born out of emptiness. The theory of black hole and explosion is born out of this very fact.
Buddhists say the whole idea of the universe is a manifestation of explosion and implosion of emptiness.
The seed is sown then it explodes into a tree and then tree implodes into seeds likewise the whole universe is born out of the explosion of the black hole and the black hole is the womb ( emptiness ) for implosion.
Take humans, the truth of every human being is an emptiness that is the basis of human existence. Every human keeps filling himself all his life by possession, goals and achievements. This is what the primary problem of the man.
Carl Jung saying, “the primary problem of man is emptiness.”
One who understands the very nature of human being breaks free of birth, life and death cycle."
"What is ""deeper meditation"", Swami Jai Deep?","There is two deeper levels of mediation one where awareness and mind separate and no-mind is attained, this is close to deep sleep. This is where all the chakras are felt and awakened.
Another one is when one attains Samadhi - Turiya (the fourth) when awareness becomes consciousness.
Turiya is waking-sleep.
In no-mind consciousness shifts between mind and no-mind but in turiya consciousness and awareness becomes synonymous.
Let's understand the process :-

The conscious mind is active and we use the conscious and subconscious mind in day to day activities, below it we have an unconscious mind where our conscious mind store memories, knowledge as memory blocks and retrieves it on demand of conscious/subconscious mind.
Still one level down we have a collective unconscious mind which is part of our society/political ideology and religion.
One more level down we have a cosmic unconscious mind which includes all of the earth- animals, rocks, mountains. It is a universal mind or cosmic mind - an order of disorder before this creation or re-creation.
The deepest meditation is Samadhi, when awareness goes deepest to cosmic unconsciousness then consciousness touches the peak of cosmic consciousness."
Is enlightenment a concept only for human life and not other beings?,"Animals and birds are already enlightened. They don't have other way of being.
Only humans are not enlightened because they have freewill. Humans can choose to be happy or sad, drift to past or future, love or hate.
With great power comes great responsibility and being enlightened is the responsibility and possibility of every human being.
Every human being on earth is potentially enlightened but those who seek, find and those who sit will never find.
Enlightenment of animals and birds is unconscious whereas enlightenment of humans is conscious."
"Does masturbation affect subliminal results? Generally speaking, does masturbation have anything to do with your spirituality levels?","If you can truly practice celibacy for one year even then you will notice considerable changes in your life. It won’t lead to some supernatural powers but it will certainly lay the foundation for spiritual practices.
Brahmacharya is not about sex only, it will also include your food and yoga practices. You will have to refrain from masturbation and any kind of pornography.

The food you eat have cycle of seven stages (shown above) that lead to semen and the length of the cycle from food to semen is of 40 days and after 40 days semens are used by the body to build your body strength and other aspects of your being including subtle abilities of brain which lead to spiritual life.
It generally takes 30 to 40 days to bring back the lost semen to its original state, but it is not just about the liquid quantity. If a person masturbates or have sex multiple times in 40 days, then he is delaying and multiplicationally taking far more time to regenerate the lost semen, which is damaging.
If you practice celibacy you will be more successful, your Ojus will improve drastically and your spiritual life will also prosper.

How can I reverse the effect of spiritual awakening so that I can become back the old me again?,"No.
Why?
Spiritual Awakening happens as an explosion but adjustments to the brain are gradual.
Three permanent adjustments to the brain after enlightenment:-
Enlightenment is a journey it is not a one-step process. Though Satori can happen for a few hours and Samadhi can happen for a few days but both open all chakras and there is still work to be done on making adjustments to the brain exactly like adjustments are required after brain surgery.
Stage one: When the sixth chakra (third eye or Ajna chakra) opens then one enters the Alpha state of mind and person starts to live meditatively 24x7.
Why do I say this is the first stage? Before the opening of Ajna chakra (third eye) one is unconscious, even if many things are going on one will not take notice. He lives utter sleepy. On the opening of the third eye for the first time, one becomes conscious of his true-self.
Stage two: When Sahasara (A) is opened then one enters the Theta state of mind. This is called the state of no-mind. In this state, one can choose to use mind on demand. This is a state of great insights. All the clairvoyants can produce Theta waves.
Stage three: When the Sahasrara (B) (also called Bindu chakra) is opened then one enters Delta state of mind. Hindus call it Turiya. Turiya is beyond three usual states of mind waking, dreaming and sleeping. Delta is the waves which are used for all manifestations by the existence. Here one can control the happening of the manifestations.
If somebody tells you that enlightenment just happened it is not true. They might have had Satori or Samadhi for few days but enlightenment is a long arduous process and it requires continuous Sadhana.

What would happen if 114 chakras are activated? Are chakra’s real and effective? How can I learn to activate chakra? Is it easy to activate the chakra and can I activate one chakra right now?,"There are 72000 nadis (energy channels) and 114 chakras. There are 3 major Nadis (Ida, Pingala and Sushumna ) and 7 major chakras, 21 minor chakras and 86 micro chakras in human body. Among the 114 chakras, 108 chakras reside within the body and the other 6 are outside the body. Among the major seven chakras, one is present outside the body, over the head region - Sahasara Chakra.
There are 21 minor chakras distributed all over the body. Head, heart, navel, throat and  base of the spine are the five main areas of major chakras.  Minor chakras reside in our hands, legs, tongue, clavicles, shoulder, eye, ear and nose. All chakras are not active all the times, some are prominent and some are dormant.
When your 7 chakras are activated then gradually all other minor and micro chakras are activated with the regular sadhana for years.
Primarily, one can actually feel the movement of the energy through the chakra and one can also control the flow of energy that is how Shaktipat is performed by the enlightened Master.
You need to start working on major 7 chakras and rest will be activated with an overflow of the Prana (energy) automatically."
"Isn't enlightment same as dying? Dying is the disappearance of the false sense of I for a new one while for enlightment, there are no new ones. In both cases, the self remains unaffected.","Enlightenment is the death of the mind. Enlightenment is the disappearance of false-self - mind's ‘I'. It is the experience of the eternal that which never born and never dies.
This is what happens on death your mind dies and then your body is merged into where it came from.
There is nothing that dies in the universe everything changes form."
What love has to do with enlightenment?,"Love is the urge to be in association. Association of beloved, association of God or association of true-self.
In love, you get a glimpse of that true-self but other is required. That is why twin flame exists. Love is a glimpse of enlightenment.
Prayer is also way to get glimpse of the same true-self but we know it as God.
Underneath there is the absolute truth of your being we experience on enlightenment. Enlightenment breaks all the bondages of material love where other is required.
On enlightenment, your love becomes subjectless and objectless. Your love becomes universal.
Prerequisite to enlightenment is your capability to love."
Is there a way to sense/experience Ojas & Tejas like we can sense movement of Prana during meditation?,"No, not before you attain state of no-mind or you may sense movement of prana on and off but not on demand.
If you attain state of no-mind then you can feel the prana pretty substantially along the backbone and you can control the flow of prana through the chakras also."
"Why is the mind flexible, and how can it be made steady?","Mind can not be stopped. The very nature of mind is chaos, noise and commotion. The mind stops of its own accord. No-mind does not arise by stopping thinking. When the thinking is no more, no-mind is.
The very effort to stop mind will create more anxiety, it will create conflict. This is not going to help and even if you succeed in stopping it forcibly for a few moments. You may feel a sort of stillness, but not silence. Underneath it, the repressed mind goes on working. So, there is no way to stop the mind.
What to do?
Just watch… -- don't try to stop. There is no need to do any action against the mind.
Don't try to stop the mind or the thinking -- just watch it, allow it. Allow it total freedom. Let it run as fast as it wants. Don't try to control it.
You just be a witness.
There will be gap between thoughts and that is where the silence (meditation) happens. If you keep meditating for years these gaps will become longer and longer and one fine day one of the gaps will become permanent and you will enter a state of no-mind permanently.
The state of no-mind is a state of permanent silence."
What are some benefits that spirituality provides for society?,"Spirituality provides nothing to society. Spirituality is all about breaking free of religion, politics and norms of the society.
Society and religion are the prisons and spirituality is an individual search for the true-self.
Spirituality is the ultimate expression of being selfish. Unless you become totally selfish you can't be spiritual."
How long will it take to clean a sacral chakra by doing hip opening yoga?,"Along with yoga, you will have to understand death to clear sacral chakra.
Sacral Chakra is also called Hara Chakra and it is related to fear of death or fear of unknown.
If you are to clear Hara Chakra you will also have to breathe from the belly. While doing pranayama you should breathe as deeply as it reaches your Hara.
Hara Chakra is right two inches below your navel."
"Why have most gurus like J. Krishnamurti, Osho Rajneesh, UG Krishnamurti, etc. denounced Hinduism after becoming enlightened?","Purpose of Religion is to provide a platform to transcend the religion itself.
Enlightenment is the realisation of absolute truth everything else is part and parcel of the mind only.
Religion and God is part of the elusive reality which is experienced by the mind.
There is no God hence religion makes no sense for the man who knows the absolute truth.
Enlightened bring knows that religion and God is part of the play we participate in as a mind.
Where there is no-mind, there is no religion and God.
And
Enlightenment causes one to experience pure consciousness aka awareness."
Has anyone emptied the content of their consciousness as advocated by J. Krishnamurti?,"The consciousness is made up of conscious (mind) + ness (aware-ness).
Conscious mind (thinking) is the content and awareness is container.
THINKING cannot be stopped. It stops of its own accord and that is called the state of no-mind. No-mind does not arise by stopping thinking. When the thinking is no more, no-mind is. The very effort to stop the mind will create split. You will be in a constant turmoil within. This is not going it total help. And even if you succeed in stopping it forcibly for a few moments, it is not an achievement at all -- because you may feel a sort of stillness, but not silence, because a forced stillness is not silence.
So, there is no way to empty the mind and attain no-mind. But the mind stops -- that certainly stops of its own accord.
When does mind stop?
Mind stops and content of consciousness is emptied by attaining no-mind on self-realization. When one attains no-mind, pure consciousness aka awareness.
Then what to do?
Watch -- don't try to stop mind . There is no need to do any action against the mind. In the first place, who will do it? It will be mind fighting mind itself. You will divide your mind in two.
Don't try to stop the mind or the thinking -- just watch your mind, allow it. Allow it total freedom. Let it run as fast as it wants. You don't try to control it.
You just be a witness.
When you meditate by witnessing your mind, there will be gaps between thoughts and that is where meditation (no-mind) happens maybe for fraction of second. When you keep meditating then the gaps becomes longer and longer and one fine day one of the gaps become permanent and you enter the state of no-mind permanently.
One step more you enter Turiya - The God's State."
"What is the difference between Ashtavakra Gita and Bhagavad Gita? Also, why is Ashtavakra Gita not as famous as Bhagavad Gita?","What is the difference between Ashtavakra Gita and Bhagavad Gita?
Bhagavad Gita is easy to understand and it is a shortcut to find the purpose of life and it is kind of one size fits all.
Whereas Ashtavakra Gita is the path of non-duality to self-realisation.
Bhagavad Gita is about Karma, so it is a mantra to live a worldly life.
Ashtavakra Gita is a masterpiece. When it comes to spiritual texts on non-duality, it explains the nature of Self, Reality and Bondage. It is about moving away from worldly life.
Bhagavad Gita and Ashtavakra Gita are diametrically opposite poles.
Also, why is Ashtavakra Gita not as famous as Bhagavad Gita?
Ashtavakra Gita is meant for self-inquirer.
Whereas Bhagavad Gita is meant for warriors.
Very few like to become Buddha, Mahavir or Ashtavakra.
There are many would like to be Arjuna, Bheema and Krishna.
Very few like to be a witness.
Many would like to participate.
People find joy in conquering Everest because challenge satisfies their ego hence Bhagavad Gita is appealing to masses.
But there are very few who can admire the beauty of Everest. Living Ego is the way of the material world and spirituality is in egolessness."
Is it real that scared/beautiful deities come to take a test on who is meditating?,"Absolutely not,
Story of Meneka Apsara and Urvashi Apsara are metaphors detailing about the last hurdle one will face before Samadhi.
Before Samadhi mind plays the last trick to tie seeker to this material world and if one can cross that hurdle then he attains Nirvana/Samadhi.
In these two stories Vishvamitra gives in to Menaka and Rishi Markandeya wins against Urvashi.
Urvashi and Menaka are present in everybody. Urvashi and Menaka are the name of your sexual desires, nothing else.
You encounter Urvashi and Menaka every day, you just have to look inside."
"Can you experience anything in deep sleep? Is is not that you experience ""nothingness"" in deep sleep?","Maharishi Patanjali says deep sleep is close to Samadhi, but not Samadhi exactly. It is stillness, not nothingness.
There are three states of mind:-
Waking
Dreaming
Sleeping (deep sleep)
In deep sleep, there is the self who experiences the sleep that is why when you wake up you know you had nice deep sleep.
The fourth is called Turiya, now Turiya is not state it is our nature where nothingness/silence exists.
Turiya has something of waking and something of sleeping, but sleeping not as we know, sleeping means a state of no-mind.
Turiya is nothingness."
"If our destiny is pre-decided and I don't have ""being famous"" written in my birth chart, then why should I work on a startup which I really desire doing? Isn't astrology and spirituality demotivating?","Astrology is work of fiction, it springs out of man's very nature of doing things in all form of planned paradoxes.
If a man can select a place for a building then buy bricks to build four walls and install self-made idols and call it God, what else can you expect from an astrologer whose living is dependent on absurd calculations just like a priest of the temple?
Nothing much.
Because they create fear only and baseless fear is the backbone of their business.
Life is not pre-planned, life is a mystery to live, a quest to explore.
There are the laws of life and that is from Newton's third law :-
Every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.
The closest it compares to the law of karma.
"
What is the best argument that you are not your body or your mind?,"Arguments are of the mind and mind can't understand something beyond the mind. It can only be understood by no-mind. Unfortunately, no-mind does not arise by stopping thinking. When the thinking is no more, no-mind is.
No argument or words can explain what it is to be rooted in awareness.
Language and words are incapable in bridging the gap between experience and no-experience, mind and no-mind, consciousness and awareness."
"I know I am pure Awareness , but I am heavily invested in identity. What would help me detach from this false self?","First of all, knowing and having heard or read are two different things.
There is nothing called pure awareness - awareness is always pure, yes pure consciousness aka awareness.
What you call identity is also known as ego.
Unknowingly, you are asking for enlightenment.
Your true-self is covered with layers like the layers of an onion and layers are made up of desires and attachments - which is also known as ego - the social construct and which keep you engage in worldly affairs.
There are six layers of the ego and when we meditate for many years the layers are peeled like peeling an onion. Here are a list of layers:-
Layer one: In this people live artificial life like if they go to the funeral they cry with others but their tears mean nothing. They say Hello but to avoid people. Frederick S. Perls has called this layer CHICKENSHIT.
Layer two: This layer is pure ego. It is like - I AM PRESIDENT OF AMERICA. I AM HUSBAND OF MISS UNIVERSE. People in this layer are bit better than layer one but dangerous because they become politicians, police officers etc. Frederick S. Perls has called this layer BULLSHIT.
Layer three: When something bad happens in layer two like the death of a loved one or divorce than people like poets, authors, musicians, lyricists or people good at heart fall to the third layer. This layer is called CHAOS. Here people either become alcoholic or druggist or go back to layer two. If one remains meditative and aware then he enters the next layer.
Layer four: This is DEATH layer, where you touch death experiences of yourself and your loved one. If one remains aware in this layer by meditating then he or she enters the LIFE phase. To be frank, in this layer you need a MASTER who can give birth to your new ego otherwise you will move like a zombie or you will revert to layer two. When this layer is being peeled this is Awakening of Heart Chakra. This is also called 'dark night of the soul'. This term was first mentioned in a poem written by the 16th-century Spanish mystic and poet St. John of the Cross. From here you are most likely to descend or transcend. Be careful and remain aware.
Layer five: This layer is called LIFE. Your new ego has to take new form and new dimensions of a loving and compassionate life. You can become Epicurious or Buddha if you remain aware. From here MASTER can't help you. You will be guided by your wisdom.
Layer SIX: This layer is called BLISS. If you come to this layer then you have the possibility of becoming BUDDHA- full of pure love and awareness.Break the shell of every layer before you experience first SATORI and then Enlightenment."
Does the pursuit of enlightenment intrinsically  cause dehumanization?,"Yes, dehumanisation is prerequisite to enlightenment.
Nirvana means blowing out the flame- the flame of desires and attachments.

"Currently going through an existential crisis, I've been learning about existentialism and it's comforting but I still can't accept the fact that my life is utterly meaningless and I can't do anything about it, death is petrifying to me, any advice?","Existentialism and minimalism is another side of the same coin.
What you used to crave for now you have started to repel that craving, but not the things. You are still attracted to those things but in opposite directions. The craving is same only direction has changed.
Any advice?
Just be, celebrate your being. Neti neti - neither this nor that. Be witness to what life is bringing to you.
Never be surprised about something you get without expectation and never be disappointed about something you don't get you desired.
“You are the sky. Everything else is just the weather.”

Why is 4 am the best time to meditate?,"When someone refers to 4 am, he is referring to Brahma Muhurta. But Brahma Muhurta depends on the sunrise. Each Muhurta is of 48 minutes (15 total in a night) and Brahma Muhurta two Muhurta (48x2=96 minutes) before sunrise.
So there is nothing good or bad about 4 am.
Let me explain:-
Sunrise - 6 am
1st Brahma Muhurta - 4:24 till 5:12
2nd Brahma Muhurta - 5:12 till 6:00
This is when most yogis meditate and you can be benefitted by the cosmic energy that is available along with silence and minimum daily life disturbance."
How do I visualise while practicing on chakras?,"
Each chakra has sign with unique colour and shape.
Visualisation of each sign has to be practised alone with mudra and Beej Mantra (sound).
If the mind can't be focused on chakra sign then first start with the colour of the chakra sign and if you can visualize the colour of chakra sign then try to visualise the shape with the colour of the sign.
If you can't visualise the shape then try to draw the sign of chakra by visualising, in this way your mind will get work to do and your visualisation will become stronger and after some time signs of chakras will be imbibed in your subconscious mind associating two other senses - sound (beej mantra) and touch (mudras).
For detail of Chakras, Beej Mantras and Mudras visit follow:-
Swami Jai Deep's answer to As you said breathing consciousness opens a way of kundalini awakening. Should I stay stuck to this type of meditation till I achieve?"
Enlightenment (spiritual): Is it really possible for humans to be without ego for prolonged periods of time?,"First thing first.
Let's understand the ego.
A child is born with self, but not with an ego. The first awareness of the child comes from his ego. He becomes aware of ‘I', not of self. Ego is a social construct. Ego can't exist without relationships. So the ego exists between ‘I' and “thou”.
Mind = ‘self' + ‘ego'.
Mind and ego a are not synonymous. Ego is sickness of the mind.
Self (without ego) is a product of the mind.
Is it really possible for humans to be without ego for prolonged periods?
Yes, one can live without ego forever.
Enlightenment causes the disconnection of self from ego, one is not identified with ego anymore.
The ego will be utilitarian, not the master of an enlightened being."
"The spiritual teachers say there’s nothing to do to become enlightened, that there’s no technique if there’s nothing to do. How come I’m not enlightened yet?","
It is always the end that determines your chances of getting enlightened and the end is elusive till you reach.
But still, where you should start your journey is more important than the end.
You can read just about anything Maharishi Ramana (Who am I?), Nisargadatta Maharaj (I am that), J. Krishnamurthi, even Teja Anand (most popular on quora), Brian Jones (Englishman writes good English), UG KRISHNAMURTI (most practical answers as a common man), Sadhguru (he is just a drop) or Oceanic Osho (most notorious).
Now the priceless question is
Where should one start seeking?
First thing first:-
Seeking is essentially useless if you don't ask the right questions. Asking right existential questions is the key to self-realisation. You have to be careful while asking questions before you read anything.
You should start from your inside Guru, it doesn't matter what you read whether it is Gita, Quran or Bible.
Right existential questions which address your immediate concerns not superficial questions of fictitious problems. Questions which are related to your existential crisis.
Only the right questioning will lead you in the right direction."
With what can you replace meditation?,"You may have a thousand and one questions about meditation. But there is only one meditation all others are either variations or tranquillizers.
Witnessing is the only meditation you will ever need in your life.
Why?
Because witnessing is closer to the true nature of awareness. Witnessing has seeds of the state called Turiya.
There are three states of mind - waking, dreaming and sleeping. There is a fourth which is called Turiya and it is not state it is our nature.
Turiya has something of waking and something of sleeping, sleeping not as we know, sleeping means a state of no-mind.
There is no dreaming in Turiya.
All meditations may lead to stillness but only witnessing leads to no-mind - silence.
Just watch your mind, allow it. Allow it total freedom. Let it run as fast as it wants. You don't try in any way to control it. You just be a witness.
There will be gaps between thoughts and that is where meditation happens. If you keep meditating for years, these gaps will become longer and longer and one fine day one of the gaps will become permanent and you will attain no-mind forever.
Now you don't need to meditate, your life will become a meditation.
The culmination of meditation is to become meditation forever."
How do enlightened people view mystical experiences other people claim to have?,"Mystical experiences happen to potentially enlightened people because they live in mind and anything beyond mind seems mystical. Mind envelopes reality and people report mystical experiences whereas they actually experience reality without prejudice.
Enlightened people live in pure consciousness aka awareness, not muddled by the duality of mind, thus there are no mystical experiences for enlightened people."
What are your thoughts on the U.K. textbook that links Hinduism with terror?,"Hinduism can never be connected to terrorism because Hinduism or Hindus never killed any Jesus, Socrates or Mansur Hallaj.
India is the land of people who taught this world humanity.
We have not respected money and power the way we have given respect to people like Krishna, Buddha and Mahavir who witnessed absolute truth.
India is not a country, India is a way of life which can save this world."
Kundalini🔥after a Kundalini awakening one can feel currents of hot and cold energy why does it happen and how long does it last?,"What Ashok Kulkarni answered is short and complete.
But I want to add a few observations:-
If the kundalini is awakened through Ida Nadi then the permanent flow of prana through Sushumna Nadi can happen pretty soon maybe in a few months.
If the kundalini is awakened through Pingala then the permanent flow of Prana through Sushumna Nadi takes longer time comparatively, maybe years.
Concept of moon (Ida Nadi) ascension is called moon because it is smooth.
And Sun (Pingala Nadi) ascension is called sun because it is painful and full of negative symptoms.
Stabilisation of Prana energy happens through Sushumna Nadi which is along the backbone and you can feel the sensation, it feels like an earthworm is moving upward gradually pausing at each chakra for a few seconds or minutes.
Update:- Prana Energy can change the path from Pingala Nadi to Ida Nadi if one starts to live by heart and the same is true vice-versa.
The resultant personality of the person might show signs attributed to the path one travelled from Muladhara to Sahasrara.
But so far as experience is concerned, it is the same whether you come through sun ascension or moon ascension. Both will take you into bliss. But where moon ascension will bring relaxation and rest, sun ascension will lead to immense action.
Moon ascension will bring blissfulness of Buddha whereas Sun ascension will bring blissfulness of Krishna. Bliss is common to both but with one difference: the bliss of the sun ascension will be creative and the bliss of moon ascension will dissolve itself in the great silence- the emptiness."
Are duality and non-duality two sides of the same coin?,"Absolutely not.
Let's take better analogy and it would be duality is in two shores of the river and non-duality is between two shores in the steady flow of the river and that is witnessing or observing.
Non-duality is neither this nor that, just be a witness (Sakshi).
Meditation by witnessing and non-duality is practised to be witness till the observer (mind) is observed (by awareness).
Witnessing is true-nature of the awareness but mind covers it with duality because of the very nature of it of doing and being active.
Witnessing just goes closer to the very non-dual nature of awareness."
"What benefit or advantage does an enlightened person have in dealing with the world, when compared to an unenlightened one?","Everybody is potentially enlightened. The only difference is of the social construct that separates enlightened and potentially enlightened.
The enlightened person doesn't get identified with persons, possessions and relationships hence he is unaffected by things happening around (or not happening around). That is why Buddha said, “There is a way to end suffering”. Enlightenment is the end of suffering.
The world is same for everybody."
"Is mind the product of the “self,” or is self the product of the “mind”?","It is difficult to understand mind without understanding the ego.
Here we go:-
A child is born with self, but not with an ego. The first awareness of the child comes from his ego. He becomes aware of ‘I', not of self. Ego is a social construct. So the ego exists between ‘I' and “thou”.
Mind = ‘self' + ‘ego'.
Mind and ego are not synonymous. Ego is sickness of the mind.
Self (without ego) is a product of the mind."
Is enlightenment experienced all the time after it occurs?,"Yes, after enlightenment, Turiya becomes the nature of one's being.
There are three states of mind - waking, dreaming and sleeping. There is fourth state called Turiya, which is not state it is the fourth nature of our being. Turiya has something of waking and something of sleeping, sleeping not as we know, sleeping means state of no-mind.
How does enlightenment happen?
Enlightenment happens as an explosion but adjustments to the brain are gradual.
Three permanent adjustments to the brain after enlightenment:-
Enlightenment is a journey it is not a one-step process. Though Satori can happen for a few hours and Samadhi can happen for a few days but both open all chakras and there is still work to be done on making adjustments to the brain exactly like adjustments are required after brain surgery.
Stage one: When the sixth chakra (third eye or Ajna chakra) opens then one enters the Alpha state of mind and person starts to live meditatively 24x7.
Why do I say this is the first stage?
Before the opening of Ajna chakra (third eye) one is unconscious, even if many things are going on one will not take notice. He lives utter sleepy. On the opening of the third eye first time, one becomes conscious of his true-self.
Stage two: When Sahasara (A) is opened then one enters the Theta state of mind. This is called the state of no-mind. In this state, one can choose to use mind on demand. This is a state of great insights. All the clairvoyants can produce Theta waves.
Stage three: When the Sahasrara (B) (also called Bindu chakra) is opened then one enters Delta state of mind. Hindus call it Turiya. Turiya is beyond three usual states of mind waking, dreaming and sleeping. Delta is the waves which are used for all manifestations by the existence. Here one can control the happening of the manifestations.
If somebody tells you that enlightenment just happened it is not true. They might have had Satori or Samadhi for few days but enlightenment is a long arduous process and it requires continuous meditation practices.
"
Sadhguru has said sometimes not to read any spiritual books as it may limit our intellectual capabilities. What I avoid yogananda parmahansa books and many other knowledgeable books including bhagwad Gita? Please help,"None of the books you mentioned is spiritual, these are religious books.
There is a difference between spirituality and religiousness.
Spirituality is seeking for your true-self.
Religiousness is seeking meaning (false-self) in available readymade options because your mind is smart enough to customize any philosophy and live life by the rules of that philosophy.
Like now you are trying to make sense of Sadhguru's words in your context, whereas you have just started your journey.
That means those words are not for you. That is for someone who has searched every nook and corner and now it is time for him to let go of everything he learnt.
You don't have to stop, just read everything you can, don't leave the single word of any book in this world.
The day will come when your mind will give up and then your being will transcend the mind and attain no-mind.
Once you attain no-mind then the journey of divine will start to unwind the beauty of this existence."
Do desires approach fantasy and reasons approach reality?,"Fantasy instigates desire and desire becomes the reason and reason approaches reality in the context of mind.
But the reality is beyond the mind, unaffected by the bias of dreams and desires.
This is why Hindus call this world Maya (illusion)."
Can a normal meditation accidentally trigger Kundalini awakening?,"Most unlikely, before kundalini awakening, you will have many near-death experiences.
You will have many nightmares of snakes and wild animals. All nightmares will appear real and there will be symptoms unexplainable by the medical science.
There are three granthis called Braham, Vishnu and Rudra with each granthi opening your breathing pattern will change.
e.g. there are two nadis Ida and Pingala corresponding to two nostrils after every two hours the breathing side is changed alternatively. The duration of alternate changeover of nostrils will change quickly after the opening of Muladhara + Svadhisthana chakra.
You might have skin problems and increased heartbeats and blood pressure.
These are common symptoms and may vary person to person."
Does God exist?,"God is everywhere because Cosmic Consciousness is everywhere.
Does God exist? Is not the right question as God is not person, right question would be:-
What is that we feel as God?
I am not going to give you some poetic answer here.
Let's understand.
Humans strive for merger of self-consciousness into cosmic consciousness. This thirst to be merged into cosmic consciousness we feel as love, compassion, devotion (God) and longing for enlightenment. *The Cosmic consciousness as defined by psychiatrist Richard Maurice Bucke, in his book Cosmic Consciousness: A Study in the Evolution of the Human Mind -
“Cosmic consciousness is higher form of consciousness than that possessed by the ordinary man.”
**In book Cosmic Consciousness, Bucke stated that he discerned three forms, or degrees, of consciousness:
Simple consciousness, possessed by both animals and mankind.
Self-consciousness, possessed by mankind, encompassing thought, reason, and imagination.
Cosmic consciousness, which is ""a higher form of consciousness than that possessed by the ordinary man"".
***According to Bucke,
This consciousness shows the cosmos to consist not of dead matter governed by unconscious, rigid, and unintending law; it shows it on the contrary as entirely immaterial, entirely spiritual and entirely alive; it shows that death is an absurdity, that everyone and everything has eternal life; it shows that the universe is God and that God is the universe, and that no evil ever did or ever will enter into it; a great deal of this is, of course, from the point of view of self consciousness, absurd; it is nevertheless undoubtedly true.
This book was published in 1901 and mystics also say so from centuries.
Cosmic Consciousness is the highest form of consciousness and what we feel as God is about our longing to merge our consciousness into cosmic consciousness.

Why do most enlightened people quit their office jobs after enlightenment?,"How many enlightened people do you know?
Enlightenment can't happen while one is in the job.
Enlightenment requires one to go madly unconscious and then consciously mad.
Enlightenment is very rare it is like becoming Krishna, Mahavir or Buddha.
If you think it happens to every other person then you are absolutely wrong.
If you come across one single enlightened person in life, your life will change by just looking in his eyes."
What will happen if a person practices brahmacharya for 12 continuous years?,"If you can truly practice celibacy for one year even then you will notice considerable changes in your life. It won’t lead to some supernatural powers but it will certainly lay the foundation for spiritual practices.
Brahmacharya is not about sex only, it will also include your food and yoga practices. You will have to refrain from masturbation and any kind of pornography.

The food you eat have cycle of seven stages (shown above) that lead to semen and the length of the cycle from food to semen is of 40 days and after 40 days semens are used by the body to build your body strength and other aspects of your being including subtle abilities of brain which lead to spiritual life.
It generally takes 30 to 40 days to bring back the lost semen to its original state, but it is not just about the liquid quantity. If a person masturbates or have sex multiple times in 40 days, then he is delaying and multiplicationally taking far more time to regenerate the lost semen, which is damaging.
If you practice celibacy you will be more successful, your Ojus will improve drastically and your spiritual life will also prosper.

How do we choose our parents before birth?,"You are trying to live the dream inside the dream we know as life.
These are all philosophical ideas which have been utilised by great people like Buddha, Krishna and others.
There is a reason why did they say that because they were fully aware that you can understand something that relates to your knowledge otherwise there is no reincarnation. After death, only your DNA remains in your kids nothing else.
People can't live this life consciously, what to talk about previous or next lives.
Refresher:-
A man went into a tailor's shop and saw a man hanging by one arm from the center of the ceiling.
""What is he doing there?"" he asked the tailor.
""Oh, pay no attention,"" said the tailor, ""he thinks he's a light bulb.""
""Well, why don't you tell him he's not?"" asked the startled customer.
""What?"" replied the tailor. ""And how would I work in the dark?”"
"Eventually, can Japa become a deep meditation, deep enough to spark the intuitive intelligence? If yes, how can one reach there with a fixed count of daily Japa?","Japa is an effective way to silence your mind and it can prepare the ground for deeper meditation.
The mind is chaos, noise or commotion, it hardly keeps quiet even while you are sleeping. It is always preparing and planning.
Chanting mantra and Japa can give it boredom and in boredom mind suddenly becomes silent.
After Japa, you can enter the meditation and it would be easier to meditate. If you do Japa for 15 minutes and then meditate for 30 minutes, you will go deeper and touch the state of no-mind very often. The state of no-mind is a state of intuitive insights.
I can't tell you the fixed count for Japa but what I know from my experience, 15 minutes Japa and 30 minutes of meditation works incredibly."
"Is it wrong for a woman to ring bells in the temple or while performing puja at home? If yes, why?","Pooja is worth with music and incense without the ringing bell you better go and meditate.
Meera used to sing and dance with Ektaara. Meera used to dance in the streets with Ektaara and people used to call her Mad. Singing, Music and dance is human nature and only through these three one can experience God otherwise she is just being superstitious and wasting time.
Go sing Bhajan and ring bell."
"People say "" learn to observe your thoughts"" whether bad, positive, or unholy, but when I observe a unholy thought in my mind my hormones increases & I feel discomfort, what to do?","Do you go to testing laboratory after observing unholy thoughts to check the level of free testosterone in blood?
I hope not.
If you actually observe the thoughts then there are simply thoughts without the category of holy or unholy.
What happens when you start to swing with the thoughts you enter the porn?graphic imaginations.
Then your energy starts to flow downward to your sex center and you become hor?y.
Try to observe thoughts as witness not as participant.
Main motive to be witness is to destroy your imagination, which you cling to.
Next time you get unholy thoughts just try to be bystander.
Slowly you will be able to overcome this difficulty."
"Vivekananda wrote, ""Before the sun, the moon, the earth,  before the stars or comets free,  before even time has had its birth,  I was, I am, and I will be"".  Isn't this a proclamation of Advaita Vedanta?","What Vivekananda said is little philosophical and what Advaita Vedanta says is referring to Pure Consciousness aka awareness, but both are pointing to the true-self.
Yes, it is proclamation of Vedanta and it should be because Vivekananda was disciple of Ramakrishna and Ramakrishna attained enlightenment via Advaita Vedanta, his teacher was Tota Puri.
Adhyatma Upanishad says, “Don’t look at my finger, look at moon where my finger is pointing.”
The essence of any spiritual work is always the same it doesn’t matter how it is said, they always remind you to find the true-self.
Words may vary but it all boils down to self-remembrance.
Ashtavakra, Krishna, Mahavir or Buddha they all have one thing common they all are pointing to the true-self."
"What do I do to get the answer to the spiritual question ""Who am I""?","Let's start with types of mind we have. The conscious mind, subconscious mind and unconscious mind. All three make up your whole process of thinking and actions.
The conscious mind is the logical mind which only humans have and it has doer as mind's 'I' and subconscious mind is the emotional mind where all our conditioning is hard wired and doesn't have doer as 'I'. The unconscious mind is where all automatic systems of our body are controlled like breathing, blood pressure, heartbeats, digestion etc.
Directly asking questions could have worked for Maharishi Ramana or Nisargadatta Maharaj because they were very simple natured people who used to live by heart now our situation is very different. After all, modern man always lives in mind 24x7 very few people live by heart.
Asking direct questions like Who am I? Or I am that doesn't work because our subconscious mind is so conditioned that the moment you ask these you will get an answer quickly in all colours and shapes.
Who am I?
I am jai deep.
Who am I?
I am male.
I am that.
Hritik Roshan
I am that.
Batman's Joker - a bad guy.
What works? then…..
Though the basis of the inquiry will remain the same “who am I ?” Or “I am that” but it has to be asked indirectly.
Lisa Cron in her book -Wired for the story has explained that our subconscious mind is hard-wired for stories and we tend to make more sense in stories and metaphors.
That is why we have tales, movies and novels. We have to ask these questions indirectly thousands of time and hundreds of different ways in parables, koans and riddles then we shall be able to reach our true-self. It might take 2,3 or 10 years but when it happens there will be unlimited joy and happiness. You will come to know worth all your efforts of 10 years. You will attain ultimate bliss - the end of sufferings."
"Is meditation a paradoxical game of trying to still your mind, which requires letting go of all trying to reach a goal?","Absolutely not, the ultimate alchemy that happens on enlightenment has seeds in meditation.
We have three states of mind - waking, dreaming and sleeping. Fourth is not state it is our nature called Turiya. Turiya has something of waking and something of sleeping. Sleeping not in the way we know. Sleeping means state of no-mind.
What we know as witnessing in meditation is seed of Turiya. Once you attain the state of no-mind permanently- pure consciousness aka awareness, you start living in Turiya - the fourth - permanent state of bliss. Bliss - where all your questions become answers.
ENLIGHTENMENT."
Are spiritual people really near God?,"First of all, there is no God.
Even an enlightened person claiming to be near God is in illusion.
The biggest illusion of man is God.
The one who comes to know pure consciousness is said to be near true-self.
If you say knowing the true nature of awareness without all the strings humans attach is Godliness then that comes close to the experience of God.
And
Before enlightenment, every feeling or idea of God is just another idea of the mind.
Godliness can only be experienced by no-mind otherwise there are thousands of realities and hundred of minds."
"According to Hinduism, can Lord Krishna change the sufferings or bad luck which is written in our destiny? If no, then why & if yes, then exactly what should we do to please him?","Absolutely not, the concept of God in any form or formless is the work of the primitive mind.
There is neither God nor the devil. It springs out of dual nature of our mind. No God can take away your sufferings.
Buddha says, “Life is Dukkha, suffering, misery and agony. The origination of suffering is in craving, desires - Tanha. Desires can be stopped by looking deep into it. When desiring stops suffering also stops.”
Everything is inside of you but we are accustomed to looking for solutions outside and we keep moving from person to person, person to things and things to a person. We keep changing Gods, never knowing the true nature of the business of our mind.
Understand your mind, desiring and attachments are the cause of our suffering."
"Meditation. When I follow the breathe, my mind and body can sometimes become agitated. Is this okay? Or am I ‘doing’ meditation wrong?","When you start to move deeper to silence then all of sudden your mind resists its absence. Because the mind is noise, chaos or commotion.
It plays all the tricks to keep you stuck to outer space. It rolls on the floor, it swings on the bars like a kid in a candy store, it becomes the question of its survival.
What can you do?
You can start the meditation with the suggestion, “Hey, it is just a short trip, we shall be back soon.”"
"According to Hinduism: Lord Shiva or Lord Vishnu or Lord Krishna; exactly who can change the sufferings or bad luck which is written in our destiny? If none, then why & if yes it can be possible, then exactly what should we do to please him?","None, the concept of God in any form or formless is the work of the primitive mind.
There is neither God nor the devil. It springs out of dual nature of our mind.
You can find peace following the path laid by them. But no God can take away your sufferings.
Buddha says, “Life is Dukkha, suffering, misery and agony. The origination of suffering is in craving, desires - Tanha. Desires can be stopped by looking deep into it. When desiring stops suffering also stops.”
Everything is inside of you but we are accustomed to looking for solutions outside and we keep moving from person to person, person to things and things to a person. We keep changing Gods, never knowing the true nature of the business of our mind.
Understand your mind, desiring and attachments are the cause of our suffering."
I feel lonely and extremely bad every day. I help people with problems with no one finding out mine. I just wish that someone could be there for me all the time. Am I asking for a lot?,"How can you help others? if you don't know about yourself. You are living your life unconsciously.
If you help people and expect something in return then it’s not help, it is a business.
First, learn to love yourself. Once you start loving yourself then you deserve the love and affection of others."
What is Samyama?,"Samyama is the synthesis of human consciousness, the synthesis of three: Dharana, dhyana, samadhi.
The mind is continuously jumping from one object to another. It goes on jumping. Your mind goes on constantly moving; it is like a flux.
Dharana means concentration – fixing your whole consciousness on one object, not allowing the object to disappear, bringing, again and again, your consciousness on the object so that the unconscious habit of the mind of continuous flux can be dropped; because once the habit of continuous change can be dropped, you attain to integrity or crystallisation.
There is Subject as You and Object as something you concentrate on.
So, concentration means bringing your consciousness to one object and becoming capable of retaining it there –on any object.
Dhyana is the second step of Samyama. In Dhayan, meditation, consciousness is important; you have to make consciousness a continuous flow. The subject becomes important and the object becomes unimportant.
In Samadhi, subject and object both are dropped and there remains only pure consciousness aka awareness. The duality dies in Samadhi.
In Dharana there are many objects, many minds focussed and centred to one object.
In Dhayana there is one mind (subject) and no object.
In Samadhi there is no subject, no object and no mind (mind is the duality of subject and object, in absence of subject and object, it disappears) - only pure consciousness aka awareness.
These are three capabilities of mind which are used to attain Samadhi."
How does it feel as an Indian woman when you are asked to remove your clothes and take a bath in the Ganges?,"When someone says that he is practising undue authority. The priest is the most pious egoist. They check their authority by demanding unnatural compulsions in the name of religion or God.
This is disrespectful and unwelcome by any woman in the world in the name of religion.
Religion is a tool of people who know that there is no God. It is all play and you are a victim of exploiters like priests and politicians. Politicians exploit your mind, priests exploit your soul.
You should always follow your wisdom never act out of compulsions."
"While meditating, I felt as I am entering deep inside, at other side I also felt, I am not being able to go in. I am stuck outside. What is this all about?","“I felt as I am entering deep inside, at another side I also felt, I am not being able to go in. I am stuck outside. ”
When you start to move deeper to silence then all of sudden your mind resists its absence. Because the mind is noise, chaos or commotion.
It plays all the tricks to keep you stuck to outer space. It rolls on the floor, it swings on bars like a kid in candy store.
It becomes the question of its survival.
What can you do?
Say, hey it is just a short trip, we shall be back soon."
What is the reason for practising more than one chakras at a time?,"The chakra awakening happens in pair not one by one.
There are three Granthis (Psychic Knots) called:-
Brahma Granthi - It is made up of root chakra and sacral chakra.
Root Chakra is Male and Sacral Chakra is female. When the orgasmic meeting of two happens then Brahma Granthi is broken.
Energy moves to next Granthi - Vishnu Granthi.
Vishnu Granthi - It is made up of Solar Plexus chakra and Heart chakra.
Solar Plexus Chakra is male and Heart Chakra is Female. When the orgasmic meeting of two happens then the Vishnu Granthi is broken and energy moves to next Granthi.
Rudra Granthi - It is made up of Throat Chakra and Third Eye.
Throat Chakra is male and Third Eye is Female. When the orgasmic meeting happens between two then the Rudra Granthi is broken and the Illusion of ‘I' is destroyed, that is why Lord Shiva (Rudra) is called destroyer.
People take things literally and they say shiva is a destroyer, but actually, Rudra (Lord Shiva) is the destroyer of Maya ( false world) which one knows as the world because of the illusion of the ‘I'.
Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh (Rudra) reside inside of every human and those who realise that they attain liberation - we know as Moksha, Ana al-Haq, Nirvana or Kaivalya."
What are some easily applied techniques to extend the length of your meditation sessions?,"Your question shows signs of the sickness of achieving mind. Doing, achieving and goals are about moving outward. Whereas meditation is non-doing. Doing is a way of moving out. Non-doing is a way of moving inward to the centre of your being.
Don't make a goal of meditation. If you make a goal of meditating longer then your ego will make it ambition and you will struggle meditating for longer, you will be frustrated.
The trick to meditate is to become an observer of the mind. Meditation starts by being separate from the mind, by being a witness of the mind. e.g. When you look at the mirror, you will only see your face if there is a distance between your face and mirror, if the mirror is too close to your face you won't be able to see your face. Likewise when you become observer/witness of mind then a gap is created between mind and witness/observer/watcher.
Watching is the key to meditation. Watch your mind. Don’t do anything – no repetition of a mantra, no repetition of the name of God- As you watch, slowly mind becomes empty of thoughts; but you are not falling asleep, you are becoming more alert, more aware.
As the mind becomes completely empty. Just by watching, you immediately get out of the mind.
While witnessing there will be gaps between any two thoughts and as you keep meditating these gaps will become larger and larger and one day one of the gaps will become permanent - this is called Samadhi.
Permanent cessation of mind."
"In other universes, is there also a spiritual world where a soul meets his loved ones and also made a plan to come to any universe?","You are hurt. You are looking for consolation. Words like the soul, the spiritual world and ‘any universe' are just the devices of mind to make a dream world where you can float.
What do you think the soul is?
There is no soul.
What do you think God is?
There is no God.
But you can meet your loved one in everyone you meet by being compassionate and believe me once you start to be loving to everyone, you will see your loved one everywhere.
And
You never know when and in which form you will meet your loved one."
Where did Osho get all his stories from? Did he write them himself?,"After enlightenment, he put lot of hours (more than 10 years) in studying just about everything - religion, philosophy and psychology and learned the art of writing nonfiction and fiction.
Some short stories are original and some are taken and modified. I found most of his jokes are original, which he added pretty later.
He read books literally on every subject that is why whenever you read his book or listen to his discourse you will be amazed by the deep insights, which is rare to find.
He is one of the greatest storytellers, he had the knack of it. A true mystic and master."
What is the path of Kundalini from Vishuddhi to Ajna? Is it Talu Chakra - Bindu Charka - Ajna or is Talu chakra skipped in the process?,"The sequence of energy ascension through chakras as follows:-
Heart chakra - Vishuddhi Chakra-Ajna Chakra - Sahasrara (A) — Bindu Chakra aka Sahasrara (B).

This is ascension through Pingala Nadi. Talu chakra is skipped in this case. Same happens via Ida Nadi.
Talu chakra is activated through Sushumna along the backbone.
The sequence is
Heart chakra - Vishuddhi Chakra-Ajna Chakra - Sahasrara (A) — Bindu Chakra aka Sahasrara (B) - Talu Chakra.

Activation of Talu chakra is painful as the throat becomes so sensitive even the infection in the atmosphere is easily caught by the throat.
After activation of Talu chakra, there is a change in quality and depth of voice. Vissuddhi chakra is easiest to open as it is the most active area of our body."
"Is there an infinite number of layers of reality? Are we capable to understand everything with our current mind, or for each layer or layers we need a more evolved brain? Are there things that cannot be explained no matter how evolved the brain is?","There is infinite number of realities for the mind, these are psychic realities like dreams have their reality likewise astral travel and twin flame. All are different level of reality because of mind.
But actually, there are two realities,
1) Reality which is illusions (or many layers of reality) of the mind.
2) Reality which is unpolluted by the mind - which is pure and observed by the pure awareness. This is a state of no-mind.
Now, this is what we know as truth in spirituality and it becomes available after the self-realisation because now one can see things as they are without the duality of mind.
The duality in nature our conscious mind."
"When spirituality says that there is no time, who discovered the concept of time and days?","Time is a concept of mind. The mind is time. Time is a reference point for the mind to store past and future.
Concept of months and weeks is based on moon phases - each moon phase is of 7 days (a week) and there are four moon phases hence it is close to 30 days as there is a time lag of 45 hrs - moon cycle is of 29+ days - New moon to new moon. Moon is very closely related to humans and is the base of spirituality.
Kundalini awakening is caused by the gravitational pull of Moon opposite of gravity of earth.
The female menstrual cycle is the same length as the lunar month –though it isn't synchronised with a particular phase.
Days are based on the rotation of the earth, rising and setting of the sun.
Time is not an arbitrary concept, it is based on existential facts of our survival.
How did we get base 10 system of numbering?
Because we used to count on our finger and we have a total of 10 fingers ( including thumbs), that's how we got base 10 system."
"Osho used to say that all our thoughts arise from outside, but I always feel that the thoughts are rising in my head. How am I perceiving it wrongly?","Origin of thoughts is other's eyes. When someone says you are beautiful, you feel you are beautiful. When someone says you are ugly, you feel ugly.
All your life you act according to society, religion and political ideology for social approval.
Other people have become a mirror for you. You keep them happy by doing things which they consider respectable.
You go to the temple because your father goes to the temple. You are Hindu, Christian or Muhammadan because your father is that.
Where are you? You don't know anything about yourself.
All your thoughts and knowledge is second hand and is given to you for a purpose - purpose to exploit you first by implanting all the garbage of religion, history and political ideologies then control you by all the hard ingrained hooks that are implanted from your very birth.
Who are you?
What is your experience, your truth?
Aren't you preprogrammed gadget?
You don't even have AI.
All your thoughts originate from others, nothing is yours."
"How can there be different schools of thoughts around the true nature of reality (Dvaita, Advaita etc)? There can be multiple perspectives, but only one truth? How can enlightened people also disagree on the nature of reality? ","Nature of reality doesn't change as there is unchanging awareness. But there are many paths to reach the destination.
It is the path that varies not the ultimate truth. There is Bhakti Marg, Gyan Marg, Dhayan Marg and many more.
Thousands of years ago the centre of the people was navel at that time Patanjali Yoga was the way to realisation.
Then the centre shifted to heart, now the Bhakti Marg was effective to attain self-realisation.
The centre shifted to mind then the Dhyan Marg was effective to reach self-realisation.
Now the centre has shifted way away from body and mind in thousands of things and people live unconsciously. Now the Gyan Marg is effective or rather combination of all marg (path) is more effective than one in particular.
All roads reach the one destination - Awareness (non-dual)."
Can a relationship between conscios and unconscious person work in the long term without harm?,"Relationships form between unconscious people only. The conscious person knows relating not relationships.
What you are saying, “Can a relationship between less unconscious and fully unconscious person work?”
The terms unconscious and conscious are relative and based on a value system. e.g. one person may value honesty and another person may value responsibility. Now an honest person can be irresponsible and the responsible person may be dishonest.
Now for relation to work, each one has to compromise.
So the compromise ( some may call it understanding) is the basis of successful relationship not the level of consciousness.
Refresher:-
At his annual checkup, a man is told that he has contracted a deadly disease and has only twelve hours to live. His only consolation is that it’s not contagious.
When he gets home, he tells his wife the awful news. She is devastated and says, “Honey, let’s make love tonight. It will be the night of your life.”
They make love with a passion, and it’s amazing, and they kiss and go to sleep. A little while later he wakes her up and says, “How about we do it again?” They make love again, and it’s even better and more bittersweet. They are exhausted.
Sensing the end approaching, the husband asks, “Hey, how about just one more time?”
“That’s easy for you to say,” the wife says. “You don’t have to get up in the morning.”"
Should I continue 2 asanas for Kundalini awakening throughout the week or change daily?,"Body and mind become accustomed to similar asanas and meditation, hence there will be no progress after some time.
After every six weeks, you should change the set of asanas or give a break of one week.
Even with meditation, you should not continue to meditate in a similar atmosphere, that is why I recommend going to park and witness the sounds of the birds. The sound of the birds varies every day. The weather, the wind and the sunlight vary every day with seasons. Your mind won't get used to of it.
If you study gym workouts also every 6 weeks the exercises or the weights are varied to get a maximum out of workouts.
Variation is the key."
What is a thing which makes you available or conscious in the present? How does it bring you in the presently?,"Being in now is meditation. A zen monk zuigan used to start every day by questioning himself aloud,
“Are you there?”
He would answer, “Yes, I am here.”
Then he would say, “Better sober up.”
And he would reply, “yes, I shall do that.”
During the day, every now and then he would repeat this and look around and bring his senses back to the present moment."
How many people on the planet do you believe have had or are in the process of a Kundalini awakening?,"I agree with Barry McGuinness, there are millions of people who are in the process of Kundalini Awakening.
Kundalini awakening is pretty common. But people don't have knowledge of kundalini that is why they rush to the allopathic doctor and suppress it.
Kundalini is nature's defence system it gets activated whenever there is a threat to life.
A simple example is in case of an extreme nervous breakdown brain restores to Coma to save other vital organs of the body.
In a way, it is a message to us that existence always saves us."
"I want to understand Osho's teachings, from where should I start?","I suggest you to reconsider your decision to read and understand Osho.
If you have a job and have a family then stay away it will be sheer a waste of time because to understand him you should be ready to die.
All other answers to your question are from skimmers of Osho’s book, who think they know. But trust me not a single answerer knows intricacies of reading Osho.
Enlightenment is the death of your conscious mind normally which happens on the death of the physical body.
Reading Osho of no use if you are looking for solutions to your problems.
Understanding him is out of point as there are less than 9 people in this world who understand Osho.
You can have a glimpse of the meaning of his teachings by reading a book - Zorba The Buddha.
But to become one is an arduous path, you will have to die thousand and one times before you reach the meaning of his teachings."
How can I find the right and knowledgeable guru?,"The one who seeks finds. Master appears if he is sought. Those who sit do not find him. Those who go on the quest are sure to find a master. And remember, it is very difficult to come to the right door, doors have to be knocked on. One has to wander into the wrong market in search of the right. Also, this is an essential stage of discovery. When you search, you will find that those who were wrong also gave support. Even identifying the wrong as wrong becomes a step to identify the right as the right.
The moment your eyes meet the eyes of the of the right master there will be no delay. There is no need of words just eyes meet eyes and your soul is illuminated. There is no need to force things. It will be the joy of freefall.
Meeting of the master is like love at first sight. Like sudden clash of thunders. Like meeting your lost lover. This is pure love and all love bring you into this world; This love leads you beyond this world. This is the culmination of love. And all the love eventually brings you down to your body; This love takes you beyond the body. And all love is gross; This love is subtle.
The day you find master, your all questions start dissolving and utter silence surrounds you. You become one with the master.
You enter the world of silence."
Does fighting against inner issues and winning against it also make someone a champion?,"You can't fight inner issues because these are part of your subconscious mind. What you know as fighting is repression, you can only repress the issues to the unconscious mind at the maximum.
Issues will surface when they will be triggered e.g. when you will drink alcohol these issues will come into foreground and can make cry or angry for no reason.
What is the solution?
Just postpone it for few minutes or hours. You will have time to reflect and during this time you will find it futile to react or overreact.
Gurdjieff's (Armenian Mystic) father's last message while dying:-
His father said, ""If somebody insults you, irritates you, annoys you, just tell him, ‘I have received your message, but I have promised my father that I will answer only after twenty-four hours. I know you are angry, I have understood it. I will come after twenty-four hours and answer you.' And the same with anything. Give a gap of twenty-four hours.”
Following this message it created new kind of crystallization in Gurdjieff, because after twenty-four hours he could think more calmly, more quietly.
After 24 hrs everything becomes calm and you can see more clearly.
This very habit will bring new foundational crystallization in your nature.
So whenever you have negative emotions like anger,gulit,hatred and jealousy , just put it off to next day."
How come nothing changes after understanding Advaita Vendata?,"Let's start with types of mind we have. The conscious mind, subconscious mind and unconscious mind. All three make up your whole process of thinking and actions.
The conscious mind is the logical mind which only humans have and it has doer as mind's 'I' and subconscious mind is the emotional mind where all our conditioning is hard wired and doesn't have doer as 'I'.

Though the basis of the inquiry will remain the same “who am I ?” Or “I am that” but it has to be asked indirectly.
Lisa Cron in her book -Wired for the story has explained that our subconscious mind is hard-wired for stories and we tend to make more sense in stories and metaphors.
That is why we have folktales, movies and novels. We have to ask these questions indirectly thousands of time and hundreds of different ways in parables, koans and riddles then we shall be able to reach our true-self. It might take 2,3 or 10 years but when it happens there will be unlimited joy and happiness. You will come to know worth all your efforts of 10 years. You will attain ultimate bliss - the end of sufferings."
Do most people that attain enlightenment reach enlightenment through one radical mind shift or through incremental shifts?,"Spiritual Awakening happens as an explosion but adjustments to the brain are gradual.
Three permanent adjustments to the brain after enlightenment:-Enlightenment is a journey it is not a one-step process. Though Satori can happen for a few hours and Samadhi can happen for a few days but both open all chakras and there is still work to be done on making adjustments to the brain exactly like adjustments are required after brain surgery.
Stage one: When the sixth chakra (third eye or Ajna chakra) opens then one enters the Alpha state of mind and person starts to live meditatively 24x7.
Why do I say this is the first stage?Before the opening of Ajna chakra (third eye) one is unconscious, even if many things are going on one will not take notice. He lives utter sleepy. On the opening of the third eye first time, one becomes conscious of his true-self.
Stage two: When Sahasara (A) is opened then one enters the Theta state of mind. This is called the state of no-mind. In this state, one can choose to use mind on demand. This is a state of great insights. All the clairvoyants can produce Theta waves.
Stage three: When the Sahasrara (B) (also called Bindu chakra) is opened then one enters Delta state of mind. Hindus call it Turiya. Turiya is beyond three usual states of mind waking, dreaming and sleeping. Delta is the waves which are used for all manifestations by the existence. Here one can control the happening of the manifestations.
If somebody tells you that enlightenment just happened it is not true. They might have had Satori or Samadhi for few days but enlightenment is a long arduous process and it requires continuous meditation practices.

Do all people going through a spiritual awakening believe in angels or a higher power?,"Spiritual awakening happens when you touch all illusions and shatter them.
If you have watched the movie ‘Lucy', the last scene in the movie summarises what a person goes through on awakening.
On blockage of Brahma granthi, one sees the death of himself or loved one. One experiences NDE.
On blockage of Vishnu Granthi, one sees fear in form of snakes or wildest animal like lion, leopard or wolf.
On the opening of Rudra Granthi, one will see white, blue or purple lights as it activates Pineal Gland.
Spiritual awakening happens when you touch eternity and your framework of time and space is shattered. Your belief system has to be ransacked before spiritual awakening.
Angels and higher power are concepts of mind and spiritual awakening is all about transcending the mind. If one keeps believing in angels and higher power then he is still in dreamworld of mind.
No angels, no higher power can cause spiritual awakening."
Is the noticing of your sense of being the same as a spiritual awakening?,"Noticing of your sense of being is ‘right remembering'. It is known as ‘Sammasati’ in Buddhism. Sammasati means noticing our actions, our thoughts and our feelings without being lost in them, without being so identified with them that we forget ourselves as other than them. It is the recalling of who we are… none of those passing aspects but a being of awareness.
The Zen expression for our natural state of being, for awareness, is ‘no-mind.’
Right-remembering is also taught by Krishna.
This is not spiritual awakening but this a right step towards spiritual awakening. Spiritual awakening causes one to become observer of mind permanently. Once you start to practice ‘right remembering' you will move closer to spiritual awakening."
"Why is it necessary, that people should have one drop of spirituality in their experience?","Let's understand - ‘one drop of spirituality ‘:-
It means if once in your life you can stand on a hilltop and witness your mind in Valley then your identification with the mind will be ransacked and you will experience your eternal existence which is never born and never dies.
The awareness is the fabric of life in the Universe which can never be destroyed.
Once in life if you can experience your true self then you will be free of the circle of birth and death consequently suffering of life.
Though it is not easy this is the only pursuit one should crave for."
Is Kundalini awakening rare?,"No, rather it is pretty common. But people don't have knowledge of kundalini that is why they rush to the allopathic doctor and suppress it.
Kundalini is nature's defence system it gets activated whenever there is a threat to life.
A simple example is in case of an extreme nervous breakdown brain restores to Coma to save other vital organs of the body.
In a way, it is a message to us that existence always saves us."
Why has oshoworld.com taken down all the discourses of Osho?,"It is being rehashed now it is working but not all discourses are available.
Check it out."
Is the Alpha state of mind only for the rich and the Monarch and not for the poor who have bad karma?,"Alpha state of mind is neither for the rich nor for the poor. Alpha state of mind is a meditative state of mind. It is called the alpha state because the brain produces alpha waves in this state.
One who can be unaffected in every situation can attain it easily. If you think money has got something to do with the alpha state of mind then you are completely wrong because what forces you to remain in a beta state of mind is desiring not what you already have or do.
Look at the face of rich people, always calculating, comparing and floating to future. Do you see how absent-minded are they?
But you are in the same bandwagon because you are also comparing poor with rich. There is no difference between rich and poor when it comes to worldly life.
If you meditate and understand desiring you can attain an alpha state of mind in a few months or right now.
It is just a matter of understanding desiring and attachments."
As you said breathing consciousness opens a way of kundalini awakening. Should I stay stuck to this type of meditation till I achieve?,"There are four aspects to kundalini awakening:-
Visualisation:- Visualisation has two aspects 1) Colour 2) Shape. Use Chakra signs to activate the subconscious mind. Subconscious mind understands pictures only, it doesn't work with words or language.

Sound:- Every chakra is associated with the sound of a specific frequency. These are known as Beej Mantra. You can use headphone or you can chant the sound of Beej Mantra.

Touch: The corresponding mudra is used as GPS to point the location of the Chakra to the subconscious mind, it also seals the energy in the body.

Prana:- Prana travels upward and Apana travels downward which includes excretion and sex. The secret to activating Kundalini is to increase the Prana Energy so that it travels upward. This is what you are talking about. It is one of the most important aspects of kundalini awakening. You can also increase your Prana by Kriya Yoga and celibacy. You can also try ayurvedic supplements like Goshukra/Tribulusus and Ashvagangha.
Now to put together Mudra is first, Beej Mantra is second and visualisation is third. Conscious Breathing is the backdrop of everything.
PS : Always work on pair of chakras - 1st and 2nd, 3rd and 4th and 5th and 6th.

What is OM? Is it Vishnu or Shiva or something else? Who is supreme? Whom do you consider when you are meditating?,"OM is not right word to chant. Right word is AUM. The universe is a reverberations of energy. AUM means Absolute Universal Mind- Cosmic Consciousness.
There are three states of our being - waking, dreaming and sleeping.
When you chant the three syllables of A-U-M, you will experience vibration in your body at three spots named below.
When you chant AA: You will experience the vibration around your navel and abdominal area. It is related to the waking state.
When you chant UU: You will experience the vibration in and around your chest cavity. It is related to the dream state.
When you chant EEMM: You will experience the vibration in and around your throat. It is related to the state of deep sleep.
The fourth state is Turiya. Turiya has something of waking and something about sleeping. Sleeping not in the way you know. Sleeping means a state of no-mind.
After you chant one Aum, there’s a pause. This gap represents Turiya or infinite (cosmic) consciousness.
Shiva represents AUM. It is a sound of silence, a sound before this existence came into being."
"Is it better, spiritually, to be poor than to be rich?","Absolutely not, what is more important that you stop being identified with possessions and relationships.
People can measure prosperity in terms of money only. Most of the enlightened people were from royal families. All 24 Tirthankaras of Jainas were from the royal families. Buddha, Janak, Krishna were from the royal families.
The poor person can think of bread only not enlightenment. Enlightenment is luxury, not a necessity.
It takes manifold wandering for the poor to attain enlightenment. Kabir, Dadu must have had a hard time reaching to the enlightenment.
Until you exhaust all the possible outward way of indulgence you can't turn inward.
When you will be enlightened people will still ask:-
“If you are enlightened, how come you ain’t rich?”
It is your seeking, you have to decide what is good for your consciousness."
Why does Mahavir and Buddha say that life is suffering? But Krishna says that life is bliss? Then tell the truth?,"According to Buddha, there are four noble truths:-
First noble truth is suffering: everybody is suffering. Life is Dukkha, suffering, misery and agony.
Second noble truth is the origination of suffering is in craving, desires - tanha.
Third noble truth is desires can be stopped by looking deep into it. When desiring stops suffering also stops.
Fourth noble truth is there is an eightfold path to stop desiring and consequently the suffering.
Krishna says to be blissful only self-remembrance is needed. Your true nature is blissful. Krishna is preaching Arjuna self-remembrance in whole Bhagavad Gita.
There is no difference in both but where Buddha ends Krishna starts.
If Buddha comes again in this world he would live like Krishna.
Buddha teaches how to attain blissfulness and Krishna teaches being bliss."
"If a peepal tree grows out a wall outside my house, is it better to remove it or leave it as it is? Also, if it were to be removed, how should we do it without being a victim of negative energy?","You can take it out from the wall and plant in the soil. That is the right place for it. Let it grow there and water it for few weeks.
Nothing special is required.
Buddha got enlightened under the peepal tree. Peepal tree has the same liquid secretion as of third eye organ aka pineal gland in humans."
I told my mother I hate her. She told me I hurt her feelings. I tried apologizing and she won’t accept my apology. What should I do?,"Try to hate her. If you said it you should mean it or you should never say anything unconsciously because of anger.
Buddha says whatever is done unconsciously is a sin.
A zen master was murdered and his disciple took the oath to kill the murderer. He chased the murderer for 7 years and at last, he found the murderer in a cave.
He takes out his sword to kill the murderer but the murderer spits on his face. The disciple of zen master takes back his sword and start to meditate.
The murderer asked him what happened. He said my master taught me not to do anything unconsciously and you made me angry. There is nothing to fight between you and me it was just a matter of zen tradition.
Never act out of unconsciousness."
What's your opinion on Buddhists replacing the head of a Vishnu statue with a Buddha head inside the Angor Vat temple complex?,"It means nothing because the statue is nothing but matter. What you do to it is mind game.
In fact, there is no God then what is the function of statues or temples.
God is the greatest hypothesis in human history and still, people keep blind faith in something nobody has seen.
If God is somewhere it is inside of you. We keep chasing one or other thing in the name of God.
Your search for God is search for your true-nature. Once you find it you won't need scriptures or statues."
Is there any solution to get back a person from Brahma Kumaris?,"There is no direct way it is the case of a religious cult. The indoctrination of these cults is very strong.
Primary tools of these cults are separate the member from her family, keep them confuse by altering the common belief system (indoctrination), keep her terrorized by a sense of sins and punishment and keep her threatened by fear of abandoning her if she doesn't obey.

Does Awakening Ajna Chakra mean awakening all the lower chakras?,"Of course, Ajna chakra is awakened when energy travels through all 5 chakras and opening them below Ajna chakra.
Nobody can awaken Ajna chakra directly if it does happen then it will be more like a spiritual experience, not awakening.
I know people who had that experience but then they strive for that blissful state for decades.
Kundalini/chakras should be awakened systematically not forcefully or by chance for permanent blissfulness."
What should one do to break Rudra Granthi?,You can't break Rudra Granthi directly. You will have to break Brahma granthi first then everything is a breeze. Vishnu Granthi might be automatically be broken if you live by heart not head.
Is the cold stream like a burst in the spine up to the neck Kundalini rise through Ida?,It is like cold sensation rising slowly along the spine ( speed can be controlled by imagining colours of chakras) and then boom at third eye one more step Sahasrara chakra with Bindu and Talu chakra opening all at once.
Can gastric problems continue long after Kundalini awakening? How do you work on Solar Plexus?,"There are three Granthis (psychic knots) these are called Brahma, Vishnu and Rudra (Mahesh or Shiva).
These Granthis are opened in sequence as follows:-
When 1st Chakra (Root Chakra) meets Sacral chakra this opens the Brahma Granthi, during this ascension one will have skin problems along the inner thighs area.
When 3rd Chakra (Solar Plexus chakra) meets 4th Chakra ( Heart Chakra) this opens the Vishnu Granthi. During this ascension, one will have digestion (may lead to Jaundice) or gall bladder problems.
But after the ascension, all the problem will become mild but remain.
When 5th Chakra (Throat Chakra) meets the Third eye this opens Rudra Granthi. From now onwards all your problems will be gone. Because you become master of your mind and all the problems are caused by the mind. Every problem will be removed magically.
Here is a list of problems that will be solved after the opening of Rudra Granthi:-
High blood pressure, gallbladder or kidney stones, jaundice, eyesight, diabetes, skin problems any kind of neurosis or depressions.
Why?
With Rudra Granthi opening the sensory system works directly with sensory outlets (eyes, nose, ears and tongue) without the mediator i.e. conscious mind.
To work with Solar Plexus you need to make changes to your diet. Take light food low sugar and low fat. Keep a check on excessive fruit juice.
Work on your emotional distress by praying or meditating."
Is re-aligning chakras required or does Kundalini take care?,"Kundalini ascension happens in two way through Pingala or Ida ( Nadis). Ascension through Pingala is sun ascension and ascension through Ida is called moon ascension. The Sun ascension is painful and it takes time and moon ascension is relatively smooth.

Kundalini stabilisation happens through third Nadi Sushumna, it can be felt along the backbone pretty easily. Sushumna Nadi exits in the subtle body.
Kundalini stabilisation requires balance in three aspects of life - body ( healthy food), heart (positive emotions like surrender, forgiveness, gratitude and compassion) and mind (thoughts purification by meditation).
At any time if there is an extreme imbalance in any of three aspects of life Kundalini returns to a dormant state or the flow of energy reduces to a minimum.

"Meditation masters often invite you to ""stop thinking"", but is that really possible and convenient?","This question reminds me of the beautiful Tibetan parable.
An old saint knew how to fly and he became very famous. A young man got interested in knowing the secret. He swore that he would devote his whole life to know the secret to flying. He started to live with the old saint.
………
After a few months, tired of the young man, because twenty-four hours a day he was there…Finally the old man got fed up. He told the young fellow, “Today I am going to tell you the secret. It is not very difficult. It is very simple.”
He said, “Everything is hidden in the mantra —Om mani Padme hum.”
The young man said, “ Don't fool me. This is the mantra everybody knows.”
The old saint said, “ I am going to give you the secret key to open this mantra nobody knows.”
The young man said, “Key? I have never heard that there is a key to open the mantra.”
“The key is, while you are repeating the mantra – just for three minutes – don’t let any monkey pop into your head.”
The young man said, “You seem to be an old idiot! In my whole life, I have never thought of a monkey. Why should I think of one?”
He rushed down the stairs of the temple where the old saint lived. But strangely, even though he was not chanting the mantra, monkeys started coming. He would close his eyes and they would be there. He would run to this side and they would be there. They were not outside, they were inside his head. As far as he could see, only monkeys and monkeys.
Somehow he tried to sleep but all night monkeys kept crowding his head and the house.
By the morning he was so tired that he rushed to the old saint and said, “Please take away your key. I am almost mad!”
The old man said, “That’s why I was not telling anybody because the key is very difficult. Now, do you understand why I was silent? Now it is almost impossible to take back the key.”
He said, “I don’t want to listen to a single word from you. You just take this key back and let me go home. And I don’t want these monkeys to follow me!”
The man dropped the mantra, he dropped the key. He closed his eyes and there was no monkey. He looked all around and there was no monkey. He tried just once on the way, to see what happens when he says Om mani Padme hum and closes his eyes. And they were all coming, from all directions.
All your thoughts are monkeys. Never force any thought to go away; otherwise, it will rebound with greater energy. And the energy is yours! You are on a self-defeating track. The more you throw it away the more it will come back."
Is the language of the universe/soul of the world really a thing?,"Language of the universe is vibrations. High vibration is matter. This is how we know atom, neutrons, electrons and protons.
Lowest vibration is spirit or soul. Spirituality is a journey of going from matter to spirit by reducing the vibrations of our brain.
Samadhi is one of the states where matter becomes spirit. Enlightenment is resting in a permanent state of spirit."
Why do I see an eye during meditation?,"This means your third eye is sensitive and it is getting some pranic energy and if you start trataka meditation you will get glimpse of divine soon.
Trataka"
What is the meaning of opening your third eye? How does it happen?,"3rd eye is the sixth chakra out of total seven chakras in our subtle body. It is also known as Ajna Chakra or Agya Chakra.
Awakening of 3rd eye means the opening of the third eye but not as we know the third eye of Shiva - The destroyer.
But yes the third eye is related to clairvoyant. It has powers anyone can dream of as a human. Awakening of the third eye destroys the duality of mind and illusions of this dreamworld known as Maya.
Awakening of the third eye is possible for every human being as it is a physical organ known as the pineal gland.
Opening of the third eye causes self-realization."
"Why is that many awakened and so called spiritual people eat meat? Isn't Compassion the very quality of a spiritual person, hence not being aware of an animal's suffering would surely make them unaware beings not aware beings?","Old habits continue after awakening.
In this whole world, situations are different, climates are different. There are cold climates where alcohol may be an essential need. For example, in Russia, it may be impossible even for the enlightened person not to drink vodka. It is freezing cold, it can freeze even your very blood -- a little warmth is needed. A truly religious man is very understanding -- understanding of different people, of different conditions, different geographical situations, different climates, different ages, different patterns, different habits.
Ramakrishna continued to eat fish after awakening. Now, Jainas cannot accept Ramakrishna as enlightened. Can an enlightened man eat fish? ...just an old habit, just living in Bengal where rice and fish are the only food. From his very childhood, he has been eating rice and fish, and everybody else is eating it too. Even when he became enlightened, the old habit continued.
And small things cannot disturb a great experience like enlightenment.
Enlightenment remains uncorrupted in every situation. The inner sky cannot be clouded again. One comes to a point from where one cannot fall back.
Nothing can corrupt his consciousness. It is intrinsically incorruptible."
Isn't dressing up sort of like covering up your original self and portraying a person that you aren't? If so then why do we do it?,"Yes, that is why Mahavir used to be naked. The message is “find your true self”. Being naked reminds one to be close to one’s true-self and one day you find you're that.
More expensive clothes one wears, more distant he becomes from his true-self.
We live in society and by law, it is called “Public indecency”. We can wear what is reasonably decent, we don't need to wear flashy expensive cloths. We can opt essentiallism."
What are some superfoods to enhance/boost your brain along with meditation?,"Sauerkraut is a fermented food. Fermented food accelerates digestion and absorption of nutrients, improving your gut health.
Excellent book by Holly Howe is a great source of information about fermented food.
Fermentation Made Easy! Mouthwatering Sauerkraut: Master an Ancient Art of Preservation, Grow Your Probiotics, and Supercharge Your Gut Health - Holly Howe.
Egg whites nourish your body. Egg drop soup is a good option. Become eggetarian at least, eggs are unfertilised.
Chamomile tea or Green tea is also good for brain development.
Supplements for brain development are Ashvagandha, Tribulus, Spirulina and good fish oil.
Cut sugar and high-fat food to a minimum."
Why is Buddhism much more spritually matured than Brahminism?,"Buddhism is scientific. It is free of caste and creed system. Buddhism is altogether opposite thought process. Teachings of Buddha is based on inquiry not on beliefs.
Anybody can understand the teachings of Buddha irrespective of his previous religious beliefs. It requires little wandering.
Buddhism believes in the divinity of everyone. Everybody is capable of attaining enlightenment and enlightenment is the only hope for the human race."
Is hallucination an excuse for some of the miraculous or mysterious natural or supernatural phenomena?,"Hallucination is the result of split created by opposing ideas between the subconscious mind and the conscious mind.
When your conscious mind tries to fit the situations according to the conditioning of your subconscious mind then conscious mind breaks down and resultant is hallucination.
The mysterious natural is awakening of the defence system we know as Kundalini Awakening.
There are many instances when the nervous breakdown happens then brain activates the sleep mode medical science knows it as Coma and return from that Coma and stories are very readily available.
A SCIENTIST’S CASE FOR THE AFTERLIFE :-


Thousands of people have had near-death experiences, but scientists have argued that they are impossible. Dr. Eben Alexander was one of those scientists. A highly trained neurosurgeon, Alexander knew that NDEs feel real, but are simply fantasies produced by brains under extreme stress.Then, Dr. Alexander’s own brain was attacked by a rare illness. The part of the brain that controls thought and emotion—and in essence makes us human—shut down completely. For seven days he lay in a coma. Then, as his doctors considered stopping treatment, Alexander’s eyes popped open. He had come back.Alexander’s recovery is a medical miracle. But the real miracle of his story lies elsewhere. While his body lay in a coma, Alexander journeyed beyond this world and encountered an angelic being who guided him into the deepest realms of super-physical existence. There he met and spoke with, the Divine source of the universe itself.Alexander’s story is not a fantasy. Before he underwent his journey, he could not reconcile his knowledge of neuroscience with any belief in heaven, God, or the soul. Today Alexander is a doctor who believes that true health can be achieved only when we realize that God the soul are real and that death is not the end of personal existence but only a transition.
Source : Proof of Heaven.
What I see Dr. Alexander entered the Samadhi for 7 days but because he was not prepared he suffered a coma and that is what exactly happens when one enters samadhi the conscious mind is left behind and there is no experiencer. Certainly, that seems like heaven and everything run on autopilot. Because he went deeper in samadhi he had deeper insights into reality. Unfortunately, he doesn't know the reality of the incident. If he contacts some mystic he will have a better understanding of the incident."
What is the role of breathe consciousness in activation of Chakras?,"Right 2 inch below your navel there is Hara chakra (Svadhisthana Chakra or Sacral Chakra) when you breathe the breathing reach Hara and this is the centre of your being. This is also the point of first Granthi of total three granthi - Brahma Granthi (Brahma, Vishnu and Rudra).
If you breathe consciously then first Granthi will unlock and the Kundalini will start its upward journey, once it will start an upward journey then there is nothing can stop it, if you keep breathing consciously.
Your Chakras will start opening in pairs - 1st and 2nd, 3rd and 4th, 5th and 6th and then 7th - Sahasrara.
Breathing is part of your Prana and that is why Pranayam is essential to activate Chakras or Kundalini."
"Is it true that after awakening, a person becomes insane for a month or years and quit their job and family?","When awakening happens person goes into Samadhi for a few days or weeks where his mind is left behind and during this period adjustments are made to brain and brain is rewired. During this time if a person is exposed to extreme conditions of mental pressures, he might go mad.
Even after the return from the Samadhi, there are many adjustments to the sensory system like eyes (seeing), ears (hearing), nose (smelling) and tongue (taste) as these are updated and become over-sensitive.
Especially eyes become over-sensitive because suddenly subconscious mind starts taking information from eyes directly without conscious mind as mediator.
Yes, a person can become insane if he is disturbed severely during the period of Samadhi.
He can also become temporarily insane if he uses alcohol or any sedatives during Samadhi.
By the way, there is a similarity between Madness and enlightenment - enlightenment is conscious madness."
"What is the meaning of the following phrase from the Alchemist -"" Intense, unexpected suffering passes more quickly than the suffering that is apparently bearable; the latter goes on for years and, without our noticing, eats away at our soul…?","Unexpected intense suffering kind of makes you unconscious and you lose sense of time. You are not able to keep track of beginning and end.
The suffering you find bearable, you actually don't bear it, you repress it and that repression eats your soul as it remains unresolved."
Can we heal someone else with pranic healing?,"Absolutely, most of the ailments are because of blockages in the chakras energy system including the mental problems.
The pranic system can scan and remove blockages in the system in no time. Pranic healing works where everything has failed."
Is it necessary to raise our vibration for manifestation?,"Our conscious mind produces vibrations of the highest frequency and these are called beta waves (14–100 cps).
For manifestations, we need to lower the frequency of the brain in the range of theta (4–7 cps) and delta waves (<4 cps).
You need to silence your mind by meditation and prayers then your vibrations will match the cosmic wisdom and you will get what you want.
*cps - cycle per second ."
"Can you lose your gifts of spiritual awakening (moments of enlightenment), and does it require practice in order to retain it?","Yes, just jump back to the rat race (which is next to impossible for awakened one) then rest will be done by the others.
They will turn your Buddha into Ten-headed Ravana."
How long does a black magic effect stay to destroy someone? How can it be nullified? And who can nullify it?,"Black Magic has something to do with your consciousness. It requires continuous feeding and that is why you can break out of it by frustrating the doer.
How to frustrate the speller?
Only escape from it is to practice prayers, mantras and meditation. That can make you more aware of your consciousness and your energies will be contained in your body by not allowing energies to get dense and perpetuate to lower chakras from where doer is supposed to withdraw your consciousness.
Keep your body clean of bad food and alcohol and pray, chant mantra and meditate."
"Why do people become crazy after reading the books of Osho? I'm confused after reading some of his books as he contradicts himself. If he contradicts himself, what is the authenticity of his books?","Statements/books/discourses seem contradictory but they are not once you attain enlightenment, all will start making sense as a whole.

What is the best way to reprogram the subconscious mind?,"Unknowingly you are asking for self-realization. You are to follow the path of self-realisation or alternatively, you can reprogram the subconscious mind by hypnotic suggestions.
Read books for more information- The power of the subconscious mind and The Genie within."
"Is it correct to say that in deep sleep, one is self-realized and we lose that as soon as we wake up?","There are three states of mind waking, dreaming and sleeping (deep sleep). Yet there is fourth called Turiya. Turiya means ‘The fourth'. Turiya has something of sleeping and something of waking. The ‘sleeping' not as we know, sleeping means a state of no mind. Turiya means waking-sleep.
Self-realised lives in state of no-mind. It is similar to deep sleep but mind is used on demand. There is shifting between mind and no-mind to-and-fro.
Enlightened lives in Turiya. Turiya is waking-sleep. There is something of waking and something of sleeping, sleeping no as we know, sleeping as state of no-mind. It is permanent Samadhi."
My purpose of meditation is to know who I am or Brahma. Is it right or is there a different purpose for meditation?,"This is the only purpose of meditation. Everything else is either misinformation or marketing gimmicks.
There is only one meditation rest all are either combination or concentration and contemplation (not meditation).
Witnessing is the only meditation. Nothing else is required because witnessing emulates very nature of pure consciousness aka awareness.
Awareness is without subject and object. Though in witnessing ‘I' remains but still witnessing is pretty close to pure consciousness."
"How can I overcome/transform 'Kama' energy? I am practicing meditation and every time I sit to meditate, I feel impure and can't meditate with full devotion.","There are two ways one is to go for a long brisk walk or jogging at least for 60 minutes. Aerobics and strength training is also good to exhaust extra energy.
Or
The tantric way is to make love frequently to the one you love."
How can a person meditate if he is working 15 hours in the office and has no time to meditate?,"Mindfulness meditation is the answer. Here's how it works: Go with the flow. In mindfulness meditation, you witness the flow of inner thoughts or emotions or bodily sensations without judging them as good or bad.
You don't need dedicated time for mindfulness meditation. You can do it all day while working. All you have to do pull your attention to one of the following:-
Body, emotions or thoughts in the present moment depending on nature of work you are doing."
"How can one make his energies touch Sahasrar, if he/she has awakened Kundalini & can take his energies up to Ajna occasionally? Is it possible without his Guru's will?","Guru can give you a glimpse of the divine without any chakra opened by Shaktipat. But the journey from Ajna to Sahasrara is completed by the grace of divine only.
No Guru or master can help this part of journey. You practice complete surrender to Kundalini power and let it happen itself.
It will certainly happen someday but the day you don't force things it will come from nowhere out of the blue.
Surrender, gratitude and forgiveness all you need to complete the journey to divine."
Do humans transmit signals to the world like telephone towers?,"Absolutely YES, signals are produced by by brain by producing vibrations of different frequencies.
Vibrations are produced by the brain that varies according to the state of mind.
There are three states of mind - waking, dreaming and sleeping.
Waking state produces beta waves 14 cps to 100 cps depending on thinking.
Alpha is dreaming state 8 to 13 cps.
Theta is the third state is “AHA” insights 4–7 cps.
Delta is a deep sleep state lower than 3 cps where total no-mind exists.
The Delta vibrations are also used by existence for manifestation.
If you can control the state of mind you can control this universe manifestation by using Delta waves.
*cps cycle per second."
Does acknowledging our ego and not letting it win over us is itself a ego? Example =>I argue with someone-I know they are right-but still I argue-I acknowledge it's my ego's play-I dont want my ego to win-so I give up to that person-is this also ego?,"Ego is not about winning or losing. You give in that is also ego, when you argue that is ego. Ego is subtle.
Doing is there in both cases. You don't kill ego by giving in, letting others win is another facet of ego. Both are part of your dual nature.
You will have to transcend ego to be free of it. You can transcend ego by non-doing.
You can transcend ego by witnessing. Don't argue, don't let others win. Just witness your emotions (ego) inside of you. Just postpone your action and reaction for few minutes."
What's the difference between a teacher and a guru?,"Teacher gives you the knowledge and Guru/ Master gives you knowing.
Teacher shares his secondhand bookish knowledge and master shares his experience.
Teacher stuffs you with irrelevant garbage and master shows you the path to remove it.
Teacher program you for society and master deprograms you of conditioning.
Teacher is part of mass conditioning system of politics and religion to control and dominate you. Master is part of your true-self.
Teacher produces perfect crowd and master produces perfect rebel.
Teacher is slingshot. Master is atom bomb.
The teacher is conditioned himself and master is enlightened."
"Today while I was sleeping, I felt that someone was pulling me by my legs for about 2 minutes and then I asked Devi Durga to help me then I got her help. What is happening with me?","Generally, this happens when your meditation, prayer, bhajan or kirtan is going deeper and touching the unconscious mind.
Every repression or trauma is buried in the unconscious mind and when your awareness touches it, it comes out as physical interpretation of real like dreams.
Yes, your kundalini is also affected during this process. You have touched the second chakra (Hara chakra). Hara chakra is related to near-death experiences."
Are enlightened beings immune to all forms of brainwashing/mind control/indoctrination? Does spiritual enlightenment also remove a person's past brainwashing accumulated throughout their lifetime?,"Enlightenment is essentially total brainwash of subconscious mind, though the memories and learnings remain intact.
Enlightenment means washing all indoctrination which also includes the concept of God.
Enlightenment washes not only past conditioning but also conditioning of last 14 generations.
Enlightenment is a complete mutation of DNA."
What happens when your throat chakra is blocked?,"Throat chakra is never blocked. The only blockages happen at 2nd, 4th and 6th chakra.
I.e. Hara Chakra, Heart Chakra and Third Chakra ( Ajna Chakra)."
What is the difference between pride and ego?,"Both are the same. Pride is finding meaning in what you think you are and ego is finding meaning in what you think you can be.
These are beautiful words for false-self. Whereas your true-self is beyond pride and ego."
What is the likelihood of Donald Trump sparking a war with China?,"Just to save his presidency, he will try to fake it.
All Republicans have done that whether Ronald Reagan, George Bush or now Donald Trump.
Republicans try to stick to the presidency and fool Americans or the world.
Hidden agenda is they want to be in power and power is slipping away.
They have a long history of starting war.
Donald Trump is a bit late to sense his defeat in the election."
Are Leo Gura’s actualized-org enlightenment experience videos real?,"Enlightenment is not an experience, because the experiencer - ‘ the mind' is left behind, when samadhi happens there is no experiencer hence there is no experience.
Yes, there can be inferences by the mind after the end of Samadhi, which can't be exactly (only guesswork) what happened in samadhi or during enlightenment."
Is hearing voices just hearing kundalini? Is dreaming just engaging with kundalini?,"Generally hearing voices happens when your meditation is going deeper and touching the unconscious mind.
Every repression or trauma is buried in the unconscious mind and when your awareness touches it, it comes out as physical interpretation of hearing voices.
Yes, your kundalini is also affected during this process. You have touched the second chakra (Hara chakra). Hara chakra is related to near-death experiences."
I have been meditating for 2 years and suddenly I am getting a heating sensation at the region between my eyes whenever I meditate. What is it?,"Most probably you are concentrating. Meditation is neither concentration nor contemplation.
These are doing and meditation is non-doing. Doing is to move outward and non-doing is to move inward.
Meditation is witnessing. Edward De Bono has invented a word for it “PO”.
Just witness the sound you hear, witness the touch of the wind on your face, witness your thoughts.
There are gaps between thoughts and that is where meditation happens. When you keep meditating for years one fine day one of the gaps will come and become permanent.
You enter the state of no-mind permanently. One step more you will enter Samadhi - Turiya."
Why can't I focus on breathing for even 2 min?,"Focusing on breathing is not meditation. It is concentration.
Meditation is neither concentration nor contemplation.
Meditation is witnessing. Let the breathing flow naturally. Just witness the flow of breathing."
Why does human ego keep on increasing with age? Why do we stop learning and start showing fake pride?,"With increasing age, the conditioning of the mind gets consolidated. One becomes more closed and sealed.
The older person starts to be identified by his mental conditioning. They grow older, they don't grow. It becomes nearly impossible to change them. All their superstitions and beliefs become hardwired in them.
The actor thinks I am best actor and doing great service to people.
The doctor thinks I am the best doctor and I am God.
Army man thinks this country exists because of me.
They become pious egoist.
Their world becomes fixed.
But the fact is nothing is lost when they will be gone.
There is nothing you can do about it. Just be little understanding and let them enjoy their dreamland."
How did you deal with your narc ex getting away with everything without an apology or facing any karma?,"He is already ex. Now you have to deal with yourself, not your ex. You don't have control over his karma.
He didn't deserve your affection and love.
You have a chance to restart your life your way. Old rotten baggage of him is gone forever.
Look around life is because you are. There is nothing in this world more important than you. Everything is here because you are alive. You were living your life before he came into your life. Now you are again without him, back to what you were. Nothing lost or gained.
Join the gym, go to places you loved, do what you love to do. Find yourself again.
You are complete. Enjoy your aloneness.
Celebrate your freedom."
"As per Hinduism, what effect does it bring when we chant Laxmi Beej Mantra?","Arti and bhajans are for common people. Mantras work if it is chanted by the enlightened person by the mind.
Ripples created by the chanting of mantras by a mouth don't reach the cosmic consciousness because of high-frequency waves travel a lesser distance as compared to low-frequency waves because of energy transfer to the medium.
e.g. Mantras to work should be chanted by the mind at Delta frequency which can propagate to the cosmic consciousness. Sound waves can't travel a long distance."
"It is believed that a person has access to only 10% of the brain. Is it true, or can we go beyond that?","The brain has various sections capable of performing specific tasks.
There is a conscious mind, subconscious mind, unconscious mind, the collective unconscious mind and cosmic unconscious mind.
Carl Gustav Jung could identify up to unconscious mind. Only mystics can access unconscious mind, collective unconscious mind and cosmic unconscious mind.
The conscious mind is the narrowest window to the outer world which is less than 5% of the brain.
If you can access 33% of your brain you will become enlightened.
Scientists use pretty close to 28% of brain with a narrow focus thus they are able to register breakthrough invention.
You can certainly access 80% of the brain but then you will have to meditate for years ( at least 10000 hrs) and also sharpen the wisdom by breaking the limiting beliefs or conditioning of your last 14 generations which are inside your genetic code aka DNA."
"Hare Krishna, I have 2 questions, 1) According to Hindu scriptures and Islamic and Christian scripture, Maya and shaitan stops us to beleive God or to worship God. Is Maya and Shaitan are same? 2) What is the difference between Maya and Yogmaya?","Religions are the work of lower level of consciousness. The work of primitive minds.
Neither there is God nor devil. These ideas stem out of the dual nature of the mind.
This universe is a dance of opposites forces hence we are restricted to duality.
Day and night, good or bad, happiness or sadness, success and failure, yes or no etc etc.
Divinity is in transcending the duality. Take a look at Vedanta and non-duality.
Maya is looking at this world through narrow window of perception and beliefs."
What is natural frequency of human body?,"Vibrations are produced by the brain that varies according to the state of mind.
There are three states of mind - waking, dreaming and sleeping.
Waking state produces beta waves 14 cps to 100 cps depending on thinking.
Alpha is dreaming state 8 to 13 cps.
Theta is the third state is “AHA” insights 4–7 cps.
Delta is a deep sleep state lower than 3 cps where no-mind exists.
The Delta vibrations are also used by existence for manifestation. If you can control the state of mind you can control this universe manifestation.
*cps cycle per second."
Is overthinking and consciousness related?,"Overthinking is the result of the split that happens between the conscious mind and the subconscious mind.
When you try to fit things externally based on your beliefs of subconscious conditioning.
Thinking is essentially part of consciousness.
What is consciousness?
Consciousness is awareness + thinking (conscious mind).
What is awareness?
Awareness is consciousness - conscious mind or pure consciousness."
"If you recite mantras sitting in simple Pooja position, eyes closed, can it be considered as meditation? I tried many ways to meditate but find this one working. Can it be considered as meditation? ","It is not meditation but it can prepare the ground for meditation after few weeks.
Chanting mantra is kind of doing and meditation is non-doing. Doing is going outward and meditation is moving inward.
You can keep doing chanting till you find yourself comfortable of witnessing your thoughts. It will happen in few weeks or months. Something is better than nothing."
Many people say that this world is Maya or an illusion. Can you explain how?,"This world is an illusion because whatever you hold as true proves to be false and still the man keeps making the same mistakes hundred and one times.
I met an acquaintance of mine in his fifties with 22–23 years old beautiful girl with highlighted hairs in Punjabi pink suit.
I asked him, “who is she?”
He said, “She is my wife.”
I said, “ Last time I met you, you were with Dimpy - your third wife.”
He said, “ This is my fourth wife.”
Now if he couldn't learn anything from three marriages or divorces then when will he learn that marriage is not for him?
This world is an illusion because it remains a quest for more and many.
One more degree, one more girlfriend, one more car, one more pen, one more watch.
A man remains hypnotised by desires and attachments moving in circles all his life not knowing his true-self.
The world becomes meaningless and life becomes meaningful once you know your true-self by breaking nested loops of desires and attachments."
"Could the experience that I had some years back, when suddenly I felt strongly that everybody around me were living inside a bubble whereas I had come out of it permanently… .an experience of awakening?","You seemed to step in somewhere you had been before in your previous life.
This is a flashback from prevoius life also called Deja Vu. The situation seems familiar but you can't recall because this situation has something to do with previous life.
In previous life you must have been in same situation and memory of that is buried in the cosmic mind. Your awareness can relate but your mind can't remember."
Is spiritual ego the most dangerous type of ego?,"Yes, the spiritual ego can be dangerous.
Why?
We have to understand the difference between self-realisation and enlightenment.
Self-realisation is the realisation of true-self. It is the only dewdrop which has become aware of itself. There is self and it can revert to the ego. The self and ego are very similar, so it happens sometimes that a self-realized man becomes a pious egoist. His egoism might give him a reason to commit crimes also. It can be dangerous. These people become mainly religious cult guru.
Shoko Asahara, the doomsday cult leader who masterminded the 1995 sarin gas attack which killed 13 people, has been executed by Japan. His Aum Shinrikyo cult was a distorted mix of Buddhist and Hindu rituals along with Christian teachings.
Whereas, enlightenment is the ultimate truth. The path of self-realization to enlightenment is a quantum leap. Ocean drops into dewdrop. You are no more, only existence is. After enlightenment desires, ambitions and relations don't remain attachments.
One can have a spiritual ego depending on the level of realisation."
"People claim, often after a spiritual awakening, that we are all connected and everything is one. What is your understanding of this concept?","Spiritual awakening and enlightenment are two different levels of awakening.
Spiritual awakening is self-realization. Where one had few days of samadhi (turiya) then return to normal and live in a state of no-mind 24X7 or rooted in the state of Theta waves.
Enlightenment is living life rooted in Samadhi (Turiya) 24x7. This is the state of Delta waves. Universe uses delta waves for manifestation.
Human has three states of mind - waking, dreaming and sleeping. Turiya is the fourth. Turiya has something of waking and something of sleeping. Sleeping not as we know, sleeping means a state of no-mind. Turiya is waking-sleep.
One who lives in Turiya can control the manifestations of the universe and he can actually feel the connection to everything and everyone."
"If two people think identical, and always have the same views on a topic, do they have a soul tie with each other?","They may be on the same page or one of them is pretending to agree.
What is soul? Using big words ‘Twin flame' or ‘soul tie’ doesn't mean a thing.
The Sartre's famous quotation ""L'enfer, c'est les autres"" or ""Hell is other people"" verifies that two person agreeing to everything is not only superficial but at least one of them has malafide intention lurking behind his actions.
It doesn't happen or rather person should disagree more often if they are natural and true."
How do you know when you have awakened spiritually?,"Let's find out if you can comprehend:-
6 Stages of Enlightenment."
"Why did Osho say ""If you want to find a gathering of idiots you can find it in the Hare Krishna movement (ISKCON)""?","Religion is a prison it is a conditioning and it is used as a tool to rule the people. All religions are cults. Be it Jehovah's Witnesses, ISKCON, Rajneeshism or any other oldest religions. Religion is a cage for consciousness. There are more than 300 religious cults in the world.
Osho himself made mistake of coming up with religion - Rajneeshism. Whatever he says about other religion is a hard pill to swallow. He had Bible like a testament - The Last Testament.
When there are so many contradictions in teachings and doing then words seem empty and that is where he failed miserably.
Your inner master is all you should trust. Find peace in small things. Live life of purpose."
What is the shortest time one can get self-realization? Can you suggest any reading material? How to assess whether I am on right track and how long further I need to travel?,"Short and long is the idea of mind. Self-realisation happens beyond time and space.
Reading is essentially useless if you don't ask the right questions. Asking right existential questions is the key to self-realisation. You have to be careful while asking questions before you read anything.
Last part of your question is typically cause and effect type. But I would try to answer it in most technical way.
Here it is…….:-
Six stages to Enlightenment.
Here is complete roadmap to spiritual awakening :-
There are six layers of the ego (personality) and when we meditate for many years the layers are peeled like peeling an onion.
Here are list of layers :-
Layer one : In this people live artificial life like if they go to funeral they cry with others but their tears mean nothing. They say Hello but to avoid people. Frederick S. Perls has called this layer CHICKENSHIT.
Layer two : This layer is pure ego. It is like - I AM PRESIDENT OF AMERICA. I AM HUSBAND OF MISS UNIVERSE. People in this layer are bit better than layer one but dangerous because they become politicians, police officers etc. Frederick S. Perls has called this layer BULLSHIT.
Layer three: When something bad happens in layer two like death of loved one or divorce then people like poets, authors, musicians, lyricists or people good at heart fall to third layer. This layer is called CHAOS. Here people either become alcoholic or druggist or go back to layer two.If one remains meditative and aware then he enters next layer.
Layer four: This is DEATH layer ,where you touch death experiences of yourself and your loved one.If one remains aware in this layer by meditating then he or she enters LIFE phase. To be frank, in this layer you need a MASTER who can give birth to your new ego otherwise you will move like zombie or you will revert to layer two.When this layer is being peeled this is Awakening of Heart Chakra. This is also called 'dark night of the soul'. This term was first mentioned in a poem written by the 16th-century Spanish mystic and poet St. John of the Cross. From here you are most likely to descend or transcend. Be careful and remain aware. This space is to help you understand this phase and aftereffects.
Layer five: This layer is called LIFE. Your new ego has to take new form and new dimensions of la loving and compassionate life. You can become Epicurious or Buddha if you remain aware. From here MASTER can't help you. You will be guided by your wisdom.
Layer SIX: This layer is called BLISS. If you come to this layer then you have the possibility of becoming BUDDHA- full of pure love and awareness.
Break the shell of every layer before you experience first SATORI and then Enlightenment."
Is contradiction just another trick of spiritual teachers?,"Koan is the key to sudden enlightenment. ‘Sound of One hand clapping' or ‘goose is out' is a koan. Zen master uses all contradictions to deprogram subconscious mind.
Sudden enlightenment happens in a flash. Zen doesn't talk about kundalini or chakra. Zen and Tao believe in sudden AHA moment of merging of the drop into the ocean.
The paradoxes are the key to breaking patterns of mind. Osho has done immense work on it. Read him and get mad."
Are the 'chakras' associated with specific organ systems and their diseases?,"Chakras are psychic phenomena. When I say psychic that means it has its reality. Reality and materiality become synonymous to mind (subconscious mind). The dreams are real too. The dream has its reality. That is why astral travel and twin flame is possible.
Chakras are the symbols we use to denote and express phenomena of kundalini much like we use language to express ourselves.
Three aspects of chakras are colours, shapes and sound. Using these facets of mind we try to activate the hidden areas of the brain. Whenever something inward happens you have to use outward symbols.
What a Hindu can express phenomena of Kundalini won't be the same for Christian or Muslim. In fact, the serpent is metaphors of an old agriculture society.
That is why kundalini experience of every individual is totally different.
Just remember everything is inside your brain."
"How can we say ""terrorism has no religion"" when people of a particular religion justify beheading?","Religion is the cause of terrorism and it is not which religion. It is always WE vs THEY, ME vs YOU.
Theology is outdated and religion has become a tool of power to politicians and priest.
Humans are subhumans till they believe in God. They are not true humans if they think there is a creator. Man created imagery God out of fear.
Once we realise that there is no God we shall be more responsible and compassionate."
Which are the best and practically useful books by Osho?,"The only book you will ever need from Osho is
The perfect way.
Osho, himself, has spoken of this book on several occasions.
When the second prime minister of India Lal Bahadur Shastri travelled to Russia, a copy of The Perfect Way was in his hands. And when someone who had been seeking his whole life stumbled upon The Perfect Way at the age of ninety, he commented, “All my learning of the scriptures was futile, only this small book is enough.”"
"Why is life full of suffering? How can spiritual enlightenment possibly do anything to alleviate the pain when I will still retain the same body, life, circumstances, and problems?","Enlightenment is surely a cure to all sufferings that is what Buddha came across. In fact, there are sufferings and there is a way to be immune to sufferings.
The perfect cure to all the sufferings is enlightenment.
Why and how?
The main cause of the sufferings is mind's framework (I prefer framework to ego because the ego is misleading) which is genetic and social conditioning. Enlightenment is going beyond the mind and resting in no-mind. Now your mind becomes a slave to your awareness.
The observer is observed.
Enlightenment will not control what happens in life but it will allow you to have a broader view of what is happening in your mind.
Storytime:-
Buddha & Kisa Gotami
Long long ago, a young woman from a wealthy family was happily married to an important man. When her only son was one-year-old, he fell ill and died suddenly. She was struck with grief; she could not bear the death of her only child. Weeping and groaning, she took her son's dead body in her arms and went to Buddha and told Him her sad story, He listened with patience and compassion, and then said to her, ""There is only one way to solve your problem. Go and find me four or five mustard seeds from any family in which there has never been a death.""
The woman was filled with hope and set off straight away to find such a household. But very soon she discovered that every family she visited had experienced the death. Once she accepted the fact that death is inevitable, she buried her child and could stop her grieving. She realized that she was not unique-that she had not been singled out by God. She understood that surely as life comes to all of us, so Death comes to all of us."
Do enlightened people radiate energy even after death?,"They just dissolve in the universe as energy and yes they don't remain anyone as an individual. They don't reincarnate. They breathe as cosmic consciousness, the ultimate power of manifestation.
They heal everything as a pure energy."
"Is there an age limit for Spirituality? I am 17 now and I want to be enlightened but I am the only child of my parents, so can I do it later at some point of life? Like after 40 or something.","There isn't any age limit but if you are thinking of it at age of 17, you are thinking out of fascination.
One becomes spiritual after knowing the futility of material life. It happens when one has already experienced all aspects of life. Otherwise, enlightenment either won't happen or it won't have a depth of life and miseries. A latté without steamed milk.
Life is getting poured all the BS and Enlightenment is emptying all the BS. It is okay to postpone the idea and it will pull you again when the time will come.
Just enjoy your life."
Do beginner meditators tend to attract negative energies the most?,"No.
When one starts meditating, if the meditation is happening then everything that is suppressed and pushed to unconscious mind starts to surface.
That is why people get overwhelmed in the initial stage of meditation. They may start to cry, may get afraid or vibrate. But if one keeps on meditating he will soon be able to find silence."
Is Moha a part of Maya?,"Moha (attachment) is Maya. Moha keeps you hypnotised. Attachment to your body, face, relations, the association and things ( house and cars) is the reason of this Maya (dream world).
You keep moving in circles. You have been here millions of time, reincarnated as this or that, never settled for peace.
Desires and attachments create illusions (Maya). More and many…… is the cause of the miseries or sufferings."
Is it possible for the Kundalini to be awakened just before a fatal head trauma?,"Kundalini is awakened spontaneously just before near-death experience. Death can be psychological, emotional or physical.
Kundalini is a nature's built-in defence system which is activated when there is a danger of death. Kundalini has solutions to all health-related problems including emotional and psychological problems.
Unfortunately, most of the people go to doctors or therapists because of lack of knowledge or unavailability of expert kundalini advice.
I know people who are living for decades with blocked heart chakra or Agya chakra. They don't grow in fact they cling to few spiritual experiences they had and ignore my advice of living life of meditation, compassion and awareness.
If the kundalini passage is clear up to heart chakra even then one can lead a very compassionate life full of joy and awareness."
"Relative question, if energy can not be created or destroyed what happens when we die? Reincarnation","Energy is released as vibrations and it enters the new womb. The mind is vibration and it vibrates because of our attachments and desires. That is why reincarnation happens.
One who transcends desires and attachments or one who attains moksha is dissolved in the existence, because without desires and attachments mind vibrates at delta frequency, Delta frequency is the lowest frequency which is used by the existence for all manifestations."
What are the tips and suggestions to follow once your kundalini is awakened and pranik energy is flowing through your chakras?,"Awakened Kundalini goes back to dormant state if the consciousness is not upgraded simultaneously.
All the blockages in chakras have to be cleared by leading life of compassion and awareness.
Here are action steps :-
Live here and now.
Turn your negative emotions to positive emotions like forgiveness, gratitude and compassion.
Share positive things with people around you.
Always speak your heart."
"Do you think that reading and the accumulation of knowledge and culture reduce intelligence and are an obstacle to the realization of being as stated by Krishnamurti, Osho, among others?","Absolutely true, accumulation of knowledge is phoney it is like a mirror, opposite of what we think as intelligence.
Knowledge is conditioning because it is regulated by the government which is interested and powerful to influence common people to rule them.
In fact, religion and education is the way to condition common people.
Just remember there is no God if you can grasp this fact then there will be no exploitation by priests and politicians.
I know it is difficult and I know this is the only thing one has to realise to live a life of freedom."
Should I read 'Meditations' from Marcus Aurelius? What is it like?,"Never, because it is always meditation not meditations.
Just be witness to your thoughts."
"What are the best spiritual books on frequency, vibrations, and energy?","The Frequency: Fulfill All Your Wishes by Manifesting With Vibrations
By
Linda West"
Can brain signals be caught outside the skull directly by contacting the outer visible part of the head?,"The mind is vibrations. Vibs vary according to thoughts in our mind. Each mind is part of the whole.
In some aboriginals tribes, messages were transferred by fixing place and time and sending thoughts from miles away.
Suppose a person is going to someplace away from his village. They will fix the time and a person will sit under an oldest tree and another person away from village will sit under the same type of tree open to receive the message then the first person will send the message and second will receive it.
Telepathy works on the same principle."
"Has anyone ""opened"" their ""third eye"" and want to explain what it's like? Is it scary? Do you regret it?","Less than 1% of the human population experience opening of Sahasrara chakra. Third eye opening is also not common. Even if they open you won't be able to sustain that state of superconsciousness.
Beauty is not in opening Third eye and Sahasrara Chakra. The beauty of life is in retaining that state of superconsciousness. If it happens then one can experience clairvoyant, out of body experiences and crystal clear thinking.
Easy come, easy go experiences are more of a problem than boon.
I know 8 people who had third eye opening experience, but they are not able to repeat it and now they just long to experience the same for years or decades."
"Is it dangerous to open up the crown chakra and the third eye chakra? If so, what's the safest way to open/balance them? Can they help enhance psychic abilities? How can you enhance claircognizance?","Less than 1% of the human population experience opening of Sahasrara chakra. Third eye opening is also not common. Even if they open they won't be able to sustain that state of superconsciousness.
Beauty is not in opening Third eye and Sahasrara Chakra. The beauty is in retaining that state of superconsciousness. If one can retain the state of superconsciousness then one can experience clairvoyant, out of body experiences and crystal clear thinking.
Easy come, easy go experiences are more of a problem than boon."
Can a serious spiritual seeker follow 2 teachers or gurus?,"The question has a split personality. It is more like saying can one have faith in two religions? Because answer has a deeper meaning so it is “NO”.
Without focus, nothing can be achieved in life leave alone spiritual awakening.
You need to believe one master and his teachings. Having a master is more important than belief in God.
Path of spirituality is the highest stake in life. If one goes round and round then he will have circles, not peaks.
Have one God, one master and one love in life you will live a better life."
Is the heart always right?,"Yes, the heart has the wisdom of its own. The heart has a language of its own. But most of the time our mind is unable to understand the heart. Because the heart knows the language of emotions, feelings and compassion whereas mind is always into desires, intentions and ambitions. These two dimensions are diametrically opposites.
If you can understand your heart and follow it the life will become a paradise full of love, joy and celebrations."
"If all conscious beings are capable of spiritual enlightenment through yoga and meditation, how could the animals attain it?","Animals are enlightened already. But their enlightenment is unconscious. It is like enlightenment of a bird or a kid.
Only humans can attain enlightenment through yoga and meditation. Humans have special consciousness and that is why only humans are reincarnated millions of time."
Do subliminals really work and are they permanent?,"Subliminal works wonders as they use Theta and Delta frequencies which affect the unconscious mind. These frequencies are below the threshold of ordinary consciousness. Delta frequency is used by existence for all manifestation.
To work subliminal needs longer duration of exposure so that your unconscious mind might touch a few seconds of subliminal message. All the chakras reside in the unconscious mind and they have power to manifest anything.
There is a good deal of study done by Dr. Silva and Vishen Lakhiani is teaching a framework to enter Alpha, Theta and Delta state of mind. The same principle works behind the law of attraction. You train your subconscious part of the brain to produce delta waves and which cosmic intelligence can understand and your manifestations happen. You can check out the Mastering Altered States for Problem Solving & Performance by Vishen Lakhiani Free Masterclass.
In Tibetan theory, they believe that Existence is nothing but vibrations and that only by the right vibrations can one achieve anything. So they believe in prayer and in repeating particular mantras (sounds), particular rhythms, through which they can attune to the Cosmic consciousness and can attain a receptive state of divine."
"What is the meaning of ""zorba the Buddha"" in Osho terminology?","‘Zorba the Buddha' is the vision of Osho. Where he believes that man should live fully in all dimensions - Material or spiritual.
Zorba is the Greek equivalent of Charvaks of india or Epicurus. Zorba represents the material dimension and Buddha represents the spiritual dimension.
In simple words, Zorba represents luxurious life and Buddha represents a life of compassion and awareness."
What exactly is awakening? Does someone who has really attained it have accurate answers?,"Awakening is breaking the pattern of mind.
There are two rigid patterns of mind - 1) Cause and effect. 2) Duality
Awakening causes one to break these patterns of mind forever.
This phenomenon causes one to attain superconsciousness.
Let's understand awakening technically:-
Two aspects of awakening our awareness and consciousness.
Consciousness is awareness + thinking (conscious mind).
Look at the following diagram:-

The conscious mind is active and we use the conscious and subconscious mind in day to day activities, below it we have an unconscious mind where our conscious mind store memories, knowledge as memory blocks and retrieves it on demand of conscious/subconscious mind.
Still one level down we have a collective unconscious mind which is part of our society/political ideology and religion.
One more level down we have a cosmic unconscious mind which includes all of the earth- animals, rocks, mountains. It is a universal mind or cosmic mind - an order of disorder before this creation or re-creation.
When awareness digs down to cosmic unconsciousness then consciousness rises to cosmic consciousness. This is called Turiya - Samadhi.
The highest state of consciousness is cosmic consciousness. Cosmic consciousness is the wisdom of existence which causes all manifestations in the universe. Samadhi is a state of cosmic consciousness.
There is three state of mind - waking, dreaming and sleeping. There is a fourth called Turiya. Turiya means the fourth. Turiya has the quality of waking and quality of sleep. It is waking-sleep. Sleeping not as we know, sleeping means a state of no-mind.
In short - awakening means awakening your Sahasrara Chakra."
What is the highest state of consciousness and is it the same like Samadhi?,"The highest state of consciousness is pure consciousness aka superconsciousness. Samadhi is a state of pure consciousness without subject and object - (nondual).
Superconciouseness means consciousness without thinking (conscious mind).
There are three state of mind - waking, dreaming and sleeping. There is a fourth called Turiya. Turiya means the fourth. Turiya has quality of waking and quality of sleeping. It is a waking-sleep. Sleeping not as we know, sleeping means state of no-mind."
How do you face a person who pretends that he is more powerful than you?,"If he is pretending to be more powerful.
Then it is a matter of how unconscious he is living his life. It is a matter of how insecure he is.
Have some compassion for him. Take no notice of his inflated ego. Tell him like it is. Trust the miracles of truth."
Why do some people not like the book The Power of Your Subconscious Mind?,"People search for complex solutions and the idea in the book is very simple. People love fancy names and The Power of Your Subconscious Mind is direct in approach that is what ego can't take. The ego needs challenge like mount Everest.
Exactly like this happens to the Law of Attraction. Some people don't like that idea too."
How can we control our mind? How can we change our ideology? How do we influence people with our thoughts?,"You can't control your mind because how can mind control itself? To control the mind you have to go beyond the mind by attaining no-mind.
Ideology is a prison, you can change prisons at will but you would remain a prisoner.
If your thoughts are coming from delta state of mind then you can manifest anything."
Were the teachings of Osho way beyond his time?,"The teaching of Osho will remain beyond time. Because the mind is time (past and future) and his whole teaching is about going beyond the mind and resting in no-mind.
His teachings will remain beyond the time till this earth will be populated by Buddhas, Krishna and Jesus."
"I meditate for only 10-15 minutes, but sometimes I feel so frustrated after meditation. Why is it like this?","It is a matter of understanding meditation.
Meditation is not concentration.
Meditation is not contemplation.
Meditation is witnessing.
Just be witness to what you hear after closing your eyes. Just be witness to the wind that touches your face. Just be witness to your thoughts.
There is a gap between thoughts and that is where meditation happens. If you keep meditating for years one fine day one of the gaps will happen and become permanent you will enter state of no-mind. One step more you will enter samadhi - the god's state where the cycle of death and rebirth is broken and you attain Moksha."
"What do you think is going on with the body, soul, and mind during an awakening? Spiritual and Scientific answers needed. Thank you.","Question is kind of seeking confirmation. You are lost. How can you define poetry scientifically? How can you define something beyond the mind in dimensions of mind? How can you define victory in love against victory in war?
Perhaps “thank you” is also coming from your ego.
You better find answers in your questions than on quora."
Which Upanishad should I read to know about meditation?,"Upanishads are to be read by enlightened people. That is a journey after enlightenment.
There is nothing in Upanishads about meditation, even if there is something, it won't make much sense to you.
To understand meditation you should understand yourself. You should understand the path of compassion, gratitude and forgiveness."
How can I stop obsessing about my third eye opening? I don't want it yet. Can I stop this on my own?,"Thinking is an obsession of the conscious mind. You are caught in thinking loop. This is just a mind game.
This way you can get obsessed about opening 4th and 5th eye also.
Don't worry it doesn't happen this way.
Relax, grab a Lager beer."
"How much time does it take to cross Heart Region in Sahaj Marg? As mentioned in our literature that after crossing heart region, no rebirth shall happen. I know the goal is for Central Region.","It is a matter of understanding the message of Jesus and Buddha. It is a matter of leading a life of forgiveness, compassion and gratitude. It is just a matter of surrendering to what life is rather than clinging to what life should be.
The day your being understands surrender, compassion and forgiveness, Vishuddhi chakra is activated."
Do you think listening to sound/chakra/vibrational tuning music can ever have negative consequences? I've been listening to heart chakra music for the past week out loud and my cat became ill with congestive heart failure yesterday.,"Two villagers were travelling in train first time. Only recently their village has been connected to the railroad and trains have been passing through it.
When the train moves out of the village a vendor of soft drinks enters their compartment with a tray of cold drinks and begins selling them. The old man and his friend have never tasted a cold drink before, so they look around to see if anyone is drinking it. When they see some people buying it and drinking it they buy themselves a bottle and agree to share it between them, half-and-half. One of them drinks it first and likes it. But when he has consumed his share of the drink, his friend becomes impatient for his share and snatches the bottle from his hands. Exactly at this moment, the train enters a tunnel and suddenly the whole train is plunged into darkness. And the man who has already tasted the drink shouts at his friend, ""Don't touch that stuff! I have been struck blind! It seems to be something very dangerous!""
You are talking cause and effect. Don't worry it has nothing to do with your cat's illness."
"If the kundalini is coiled up at the base of the spine, then what energizes the chakras of those people who have not yet had a kundalini awakening.. As they too seem to be doing well?","Kundalini/Chakras are always activated in unconscious mind. Chakras are working that is why you are alive. It is matter of being able to touch unconscious mind and feel the chakras and once you can feel the chakras then you can control the flow of energy through chakras.
Upanishads say nothing in this world is created, everything is already there it is a matter of discovery."
Could it be that meditation is not useful for some people and that there are people who need to live with noise in their head? Or should meditation work for everybody?,Noises in the head are the result of conflicts between the conscious mind and subconscious mind. Noises can be eliminated by living a natural life by doing what you love to do and finding peace in small things that matter to your aloneness. Something You enjoy doing without desiring for rewards.
What happens when you observe the thoughts or breath?,"When you observe thoughts there is a gap between two thoughts and that is where meditation happens. There is a time lag (very small maybe of a millisecond) between thoughts.
If one meditates for years then one fine day one of the gaps will happen and become permanent. This is a state of no-mind, one step more one enters samadhi."
What important points should be kept in mind while making subliminal audio?,"Subliminal audio should include delta, theta and alpha frequencies as alpha frequency induces lucid dreaming and delta frequencies are most powerful for manifestations. Theta is the frequency of great insight."
"Every time I chant mantra and recite few slokas of godess Tara or Varahi I hear some voice in my dream telling me not to pray devatheys, I have experienced this not once but every time, I feel like scared and confused. Is this some sort of illusion?","The conscious mind plays tricks when it is being silenced and your dreams become more active and you are pursued not to chant mantras.
That means you touch your unconscious mind which is buried voices from your previous births. If you keep chanting mantra then it will become acute and you might not be able to sleep.
Stop chanting the mantra for a few weeks and try meditation."
How does sensationalism hurt journalistic credibility?,"Journalism is a business. Journalists are 80% failed politicians. Parts can't be bigger than the whole. Media works like advertisement platform for the ruling party.
Sensationalism is inherited in mystery. The mystery is another form of storytelling. We love stories. Stories require “ what's next?” factor. That is how the media drags the news contents and compromises credibility.
Who is interested in the truth? “ I am right “ is the whole philosophy of news channels.
Try one thing just stop watching news for a week then notice the peace inside of yourself."
"According to Osho, women can't awaken Kundalini because they have different energy poles. Does this make sense? Are all women imagining it?","Kundalini Ascension has two topologies:-
First is masculine where root chakra (male) has orgasm with the sacral chakra, then solar plexus has orgasm with the heart chakra and throat chakra has orgasm with the third eye and the final result is beyond duality Sahasrara chakra awakening.
This is where root chakra is male, sacral chakra female, solar plexus is male and the heart chakra is female, the throat chakra is male and third eye is female. Sahasrara is beyond duality.
These three orgasms of chakras are also called Granthis named Brahma, Vishnu and Rudra. These are psychic knots in the brain.
The second ascension is feminine where root chakra is female and the heart chakra is male. Females are heart oriented.
The root chakra has orgasm with the heart chakra, sacral chakra has orgasm with the throat chakra and solar plexus has orgasm with the third eye. Sahasrara chakra is same in both the ascension.
This is not compulsory that which ascension will work for male or female.
There are a males who live life by heart then the second ascension will work for him.
Some females live materialistic life totally then the first ascension will work for them.
The second ascension is called the moon and the first ascension is called the sun. Moon ascension is smooth and quick. Sun Ascension is very cumbersome and it rises like fire. Sun ascension causes a lot of dark night of the soul whereas moon ascension is feminine and it occurs in people who always speak heart.
But tantra uses both energies of male and female for kundalini awakening. Which works superbly for females. Females will require male to awaken kundalini whereas males can awaken kundalini without females."
What is the key of the subconscious mind?,"Third eye is the key of subconscious mind. Third eye is also called Agya chakra , Agya means permission. Agya chakra is connected to subconscious mind.Whatsoever is accepted through Agya chakra becomes part of subconscious mind.
It is said Geeta was directly transferred to Arjuna through Agya chakra to his subconscious mind by Krishna much like memory dump. It sounds little absurd that in the middle of Mahabharata battle Krishna and Arjuna talking for hours and rest of warriors wondering what is happening.
When your Agya chakra is operating then you can wire and rewire your subconscious mind. The subconscious mind has infinite possibilities."
Can an awakened kundalini energy return to its dormant state?,"Absolutely yes, kundalini returns to a dormant state if there is no shift in consciousness.
Many people live life without knowing the reason after spontaneous kundalini awakening.
Spontaneous kundalini awakening happens if there are suitable conditions which happen coincidentally. But thereafter one longs for that blissful state for years or decades.
I know many people whose third eye activated and had blissful state then thereafter they wander like a ghost from one door to another longing for that very blissful state just banging on here and there.
Kundalini awakening is very common but kundalini rising just below the third eye (sixth chakra) is not noticed because people live unconsciously and they approach regular doctors for treatment because of lack of knowledge rather going to mystic or master.
Note: Kundalini is a natural survival defence system built in every human being and it gets activated when there is a near-death situation."
How close are you to enlightenment? How much closer are you than you were five years ago?,"Your question implies that Enlightenment is a goal. Goals and achievements follow the law of cause and effect which is the way of our mind. Our mind is built on the mechanism of cause and effect.
Enlightenment is not subjected to the law of cause and effect. We can't proclaim that someone attained enlightenment because of this or that reason. What worked for Mahavira can not work for Jesus.
Enlightenment means going beyond the chain of cause and effect. Whatsoever remains in the chain of cause and effect is matter and what is beyond that is divine.
You are as close to enlightenment as you were 5 years ago or you are as far to enlightenment as you were 5 years ago. Enlightenment happens beyond space and time."
Will the awakening process happen in bursts? Or is there even a transitional process from one stage to the next?,"Spiritual Awakening happens as an explosion but adjustments to the brain are gradual.
Three permanent adjustments to the brain after enlightenment:-
Enlightenment is a journey it is not a one-step process. Though Satori can happen for a few hours and Samadhi can happen for a few days but both open all chakras and there is still work to be done on making adjustments to the brain exactly like adjustments are required after brain surgery.
Stage one: When the sixth chakra (third eye or Ajna chakra) opens then one enters the Alpha state of mind and person starts to live meditatively 24x7.
Why do I say this is the first stage?
Before the opening of Ajna chakra (third eye) one is unconscious, even if many things are going on one will not take notice. He lives utter sleepy. On the opening of the third eye first time, one becomes conscious of his true-self.
Stage two: When Sahasara (A) is opened then one enters the Theta state of mind. This is called the state of no-mind. In this state, one can choose to use mind on demand. This is a state of great insights. All the clairvoyants can produce Theta waves.
Stage three: When the Sahasrara (B) (also called Bindu chakra) is opened then one enters Delta state of mind. Hindus call it Turiya. Turiya is beyond three usual states of mind waking, dreaming and sleeping. Delta is the waves which are used for all manifestations by the existence. Here one can control the happening of the manifestations.
If somebody tells you that enlightenment just happened it is not true. They might have had Satori or Samadhi for few days but enlightenment is a long arduous process and it requires continuous meditation practices.

What happens at the exact moment when you realize yourself? What happens at the moment you stop identifying yourself with your mind and body? Is it expansive? Is it like lifting the curtain to fill the room with sunlight?,"Check out real experience by real people, no wordy stuff:-
https://www.quora.com/q/pauwrkppiivsshdv/Could-you-tell-me-more-about-my-clear-vision-and-not-blinking-Since-my-awakening-you-are-the-only-person-Ive-found-wh?ch=3&share=f7632c48"
"If all enlightened people experience the same oneness, why are there so many different paths focusing on different ways of ""achieving"" that state?","Your question stems out of the law of cause and effect which is the way of our mind. Our mind is built on the mechanism of cause and effect. We are used to of analysing everything based on cause and effect.
Enlightenment is causeless. It is not subjected to the law of cause and effect. We can't proclaim that someone attained enlightenment because of this or that reason. What worked for Mahavira can not work for Jesus.
Enlightenment means going beyond the chain of cause and effect -the transcendence of the law of cause and effect. Whatsoever remains in the chain of cause and effect is matter and what is beyond that is God.
Enlightenment is a kind of explosion outside the chain of cause and effect.
There is no “do's and don't's” or “must or mustn't”. Everything is as valid as invalid. Enlightenment happens beyond space and time."
What exactly is spirituality and what should be done to get initiated with it?,"Spirituality is your search to find the one who is searching. It means finding the source of your being or it is the path to dissolve all your questions and silence your mind.
The first step to spirituality is meditation or rather this is all you ever need to be spiritual. You don't have to go to religious place or pray or do rituals.
Just meditate… …."
"Pranaam. I wish to chant a beej mantra on my own, I have eggs as a part of my routine breakfast, is it ok?","It would have been ok, if you had not asked this question. Since you have asked this question, it has become concern of your consciousness.
Now it is absolutely not advised to have eggs as part of your meal while regularly chanting been mantra."
Why didn't god kill Satan but is totally fine in traumatizing people in hell for eternity for disagreeing or not believing in him?,"Where is hell? Where is Satan? Where is God?
There is only heaven — there is only the earth, sun and moon. Earth is the only paradise where we live.
It is our duality of mind which always chooses this or that, us or them, God or devil, happiness or sadness etc.
There is neither God nor the devil.
Question dissolves once you understand that mind is wired for stories and religions are stories of the primitive mind."
"How does it happen in twin flame? I do feel energy and feelings of his thoughts, but he doesn't feel mine. Why?","Is that energy of his feelings and thoughts? Energy is yours. I don't think he deserves your affection. You are clinging. You are living in dream world. You are unconscious.
Your ego is not able to take his indifference to you. Just surrender to the situation. Let it go. Forgive him.
Start doing what you love to do. If you love cooking, cook. If you love to meditate, meditate. This will bring you close to your centre. Share your joy of doing things you love with your close one.
I know it as heart chakra blockage. Check out videos on YouTube by Christina Lopes."
How will you feel if you come to a point of realization that your religion or God is not right?,"There is no question of God being right or wrong. It is always you who is wrong.
There is no god.
Saying god is not right is like finding a scapegoat for our frustrations. All our problems are psychological and stem out of the concept of god. The concept of god is the root cause of our problems. Once you understand that there is no god you will become more responsible and adjusting to life."
Can enlightenment (dissolution of the ego self) cause permanent psychological damage to an individual? Is realizing enlightenment potentially dangerous?,"Enlightenment is not a one-step process. It is the start of a new journey. The first thing that happens in enlightenment is the rising of kundalini to Sahasrara Chakra. This is not something any weak body can take. It has a whole set of problems associated with it. There are factors which can determine possible damage to the brain (permanent psychological damage).
Age
The age of the person matters the most. If he is young then he can take the damages to the physical brain. Though it won't be easy but chances are his body will manage.
2. General health
If he is having health issues regarding heart then he won't be fit for enlightenment. The good health of the person is prerequisite. If he is athletic enough then his heart is capable of taking high blood pressure and increased heartbeats which are common with enlightenment.
Enlightenment is not something one can take in 60’s and survive. It is a pure overhauling of the nervous system much like heart and brain surgery. Though existence is intelligent enough to choose the one who is capable of taking all the pain.
Despite everything wrong or right, it is worth living awakened for one year than living unconsciously hundred years."
Why is Buddha considered as an avatar of Vishnu considering that his teachings were not in line with the tenets of Vedas?,"Only truth can have avatars, not persons. Jesus, Buddha, Mahavira, Krishna all are the avatar of truth. In this way, Buddha was not an avatar of Vishnu. Conceptually they are diametrically different schools of thoughts.
This is a primitive mind which thinks in terms of soul, avatars and reincarnations just to reinforce our idea of immortality."
How is conscious sleeping being explained by the Mystics of India? How and when do they reach this stage of sleep?,"There are three states of mind — waking, dreaming and sleeping. There is a fourth state which only mystics know - Hindu call it Turiya - Turiya means the fourth.
Turiya has the quality of waking and quality of sleeping but it is beyond sleeping. Sleeping not in the way we know, it is state of no-mind. Science calls it state of delta waves. Turiya is waking-sleep. Turiya is not state, it is the nature of being. When one attains enlightenment then he is rooted in Turiya - the conscious sleep."
What is mind? How it is form?,"The mind is accumulated desires, goals and achievements. The mind is in rawest terms your sense of ‘I'.
When a child is born till age 3 he doesn't have a sense of self. Then it starts forming and conditioning of the child at age 7 onwards. The mind is the conditioning of culture, religion, society and education system. That is how we get a fully conditioned mind at the age of 21.
Whatsoever we know as our identity is the conditioning by our atmosphere. Mind comes as a tabula rasa - a clean slate.
That is why spiritual awakening or enlightenment is possible. Enlightenment is an acknowledgement of the mind's conditioning and restoring it as it came."
"Where does the ""soul"" reside, if anywhere, between incarnations?","There is no such thing as soul. Only our desires and attachments get incarnated. Specifically, the mind is desires and attachments.
What is Nirvana?
Nirvana is blowing out the candle of desires and attachments.
The soul is one another way to have an ego of a self which never dies. Look at it this way as long as you believe there is a soul you won't look beyond ‘self'. ‘Self' exists in your mind. Going beyond ‘self' is Nirvana. The state of no-mind is transcending the ‘self'. If the concept of ‘soul' prevails, ‘self' will prevail. There is no hope of attaining Nirvana."
"After a loved one has just passed on, please teach me how to make contact with them, their soul? Does Astral Travel work when it has been a few days only? Where are they, do they return home? Please give me any insight? Thank you","Buddha & Kisa Gotami
Long long ago, a young woman from a wealthy family was happily married to an important man. When her only son was one-year-old, he fell ill and died suddenly. She was struck with grief; she could not bear the death of her only child. Weeping and groaning, she took her son's dead body in her arms and went to Buddha and told Him her sad story, He listened with patience and compassion, and then said to her, ""There is only one way to solve your problem. Go and find me four or five mustard seeds from any family in which there has never been a death.""
The woman was filled with hope and set off straight away to find such a household. But very soon she discovered that every family she visited had experienced the death. Once she accepted the fact that death is inevitable, she buried her child and could stop her grieving. She realized that she was not unique-that she had not been singled out by God. She understood that surely as life comes to all of us, so Death comes to all of us."
"Why do we need a true guru? Who is a true guru and a bogus guru? How should one approach one's guru? What kind of inquires should we make for him? How does one achieve the kingdom of God by the mercy guru (2.7-8,4.34,12.9,18.75)?","The one who seeks finds. Master appears if he is sought. Those who sit do not find him. Those who go on the quest are sure to find a master. And remember, it is very difficult to come to the right door, doors have to be knocked on. One has to wander into the wrong market in search of the right. Also, this is an essential stage of discovery. When you search, you will find that those who were wrong also gave support. Even identifying the wrong as wrong becomes a step to identify the right as the right.
The moment your eyes meet the eyes of the of the right master there will be no delay. There is no need of words just eyes meet eyes and your soul is illuminated. There is no need to force things. It will be the joy of freefall.
Meeting of the master is like love at first sight. Like sudden clash of thunders. Like meeting your lost lover. This is pure love and all love bring you into this world; This love leads you beyond this world. This is the culmination of love. And all the love eventually brings you down to your body; This love takes you beyond the body. And all love is gross; This love is subtle.
The day you find master, your all questions start dissolving and utter silence surrounds you. You become one with the master. You enter the world of silence."
How do I have a calm and clear mind without depending on meditation or mindfulness?,"People don't understand that meditation is not required to calm the mind. Purpose of meditation is to attain awakening. Meditation is more like dreaming or sleeping if you don't live your life in harmony with your nature.
Here are things you can opt in your life:-
Make your profession what you love to do. Something when you do it you forget the watch.
Share positive things with people you love or people who love you genuinely.
Always speak your heart.
This is how your life will become meditation."
Is meditation and self hypnosis the same thing?,"Autohypnosis ( self-hypnosis) and meditation are the same if you meditate by concentrating or contemplating. Transcendental Meditation is autohypnosis.
Meditation is not concentration or contemplation. Meditation is witnessing— witnessing your thoughts. Meditation without witnessing becomes autohypnosis."
"Are ambitions incompatible with enlightenment? How do you reconcile a ceasing of desire, with the notion of what you should be doing and achieving?","Enlightenment is an ambition in itself. When you start seeking, your desires automatically cease to be. Your seeking destroys your desires. You don't do anything, things take autopilot mode. Only one desire exists - a desire to be invincible of worldly affairs.
And when your desire to be enlightened is also disappeared, you become enlightened.
Buddha was struggling for six years doing anything and everything. One night when he became so weak that he couldn't cross the river. He lost all hopes and that night with the morning star he attained enlightenment."
How much aware are you? Is there any percentage of awareness?,"Mind phenomena is not multitasking. It is single-tasking system much like an old computer. The processor( conscious mind) is very good at concentrating but it might look like it can do multitasking if you give close look it can do only a single task at a time.
Awareness is a function of the subconscious mind and it is multitasking. It can perform trillion of the task at a time.
The answer boils down to it is a matter of alertness of mind. More alert are you, more aware you will be."
"What is the difference between the sense of ""I"" and consciousness?","The sense of “I” comes from the experience of the conscious mind by putting “I” in the imaginary or actual situation. Awareness is a function of the subconscious mind. The conscious mind has to put “I” into context to interpret the experience in terms of the subconscious mind.
Let's understand when you watch the movie your conscious mind has to put “I” into the situations in the movies and then that information is decoded by the subconscious mind. That is why people cry in the cinema hall. Their “I” becomes part of the story on the screen and subconscious mind is blind, it has to work according to input by the conscious mind.
What is consciousness?
Consciousness is conscious mind (thinking) + awareness (subconscious mind). As I explained conscious mind has to transfer the experience of “I” in the sensory form to the subconscious mind so that it can make sense of it.
That is why our conscious mind is wired for stories. From childhood, we are fond of stories. This mechanism of the conscious mind is the slave of the subconscious mind. But the conscious mind has the power to influence subconscious mind by stories. The subconscious mind is blind and that is why visualisations work wonder.
Stories are an integral part of any culture around the world. That is why we have movies, fictions or parables. The subconscious mind works with images and the conscious mind works with words and language."
Is there any proof or experiential or any other legit way to know or experience or prove if Dhyanalinga is genuinely consecrated with all the chakras energized at its peak as Sadhguru JV says?,No it is marketing gimmick that people buy.
Which part of the brain remembers dreams?,Subconscious mind remembers the dream whereas conscious part can work with words and sentences. Subconscious part works with images. That is why we dream in pictures or videos. But every part of the brain has memory storage. The subconscious part has the largest memory storage.
"Whenever I meditate, I feel scared. I open my eyes. Is it natural to be there in the beginning?","You seem to be terrorised. You might have lost the centre of your being. Something grave has happened to you or there is a fear to be alone.
Stop the meditation. Start to do things you used to enjoy like if you like to cook, do the cooking if you love to play music, play music. Just to find the centre of yourself. Start to do things you love to do. Once you find your ground then start to meditate.
If there is an unsolved relationship problem then either solve it or accept it. If there is a money problem then you will have to solve it or readjust yourself to it first. Then meditation will happen to you."
"When I woke up spiritually, I wanted to plan an agenda as I used to. I feel the same feeling when I was the doer as if I were the one in control, so move away from the idea. How should I behave?","When spiritual awakening happens there are two stages:-
You had a glimpse of Samadhi ( state of no-mind - pure consciousness or awareness). This is known as satori. Your surroundings get illuminated. This can happen for a few minutes to a few hours.
If you don't force things then somewhere around the new moon, your samadhi will start and it can extend the state of satori for up to 13–14 days. During these days you remain mostly in the state of no-mind. Hindu call it Turiya (the fourth). There are three states of mind - waking, dreaming and sleeping. Turiya is fourth which has some quality of waking and some quality of sleep. Sleep not as we know. Sleep means a state of no-mind. During this time your mind is rewired for the new state of mind, that is Turya.
Practice surrender, gratitude, forgiveness and compassion.
Don't force things. Take care of your body. Only take healthy food. Refrain from non-veg. Because non-veg food blocks heart chakra. The idea of killing and eating doesn't go with the heart chakra.
You can check out YouTube for videos from Christina Lopes."
What are some solid arguments against the law of karma?,"Law of Karma has a hope hidden in it. You do good you will get good. But look at any powerful person. Is he saint?
Look at politicians they lie all-day. They don't even care for the value of common man's life. They are only hungry for power and money.
Doesn't the law of karma apply to them? Does it apply to the common man? We feel guilty even for speaking harshly to someone. Egoistic people always speak harshly regardless of the age of another person.
Look at the debates on TV, everyone is interested to prove that he is right, who cares for truth?
Truth wins, but does it serve the purpose, if we get it after 10–20 years. Truth never wins it is our patience that wins.
Law of Karma is just another way to make us feel guilty."
Can a person increase his chances to be born in a country he wants?,"Only deep understanding can have answer to your question. Looking at your question it is certain you will reborn because the intensity of your desire is immense. Certainly you will have to die in the country you want to reborn in. Now your desire becomes absurd. If you can die in the country you want to reborn in then whole question dissolves.
Now second part boundaries are man made look at the sky it has no boundaries. Nations are man made.
People can't live this life wholely what to talk about next birth.
A Refresher:-
A man went into a tailor's shop and saw a man hanging by one arm from the centre of the ceiling.
""What is he doing there?"" he asked the tailor.
""Oh, pay no attention,"" said the tailor, ""he thinks he's a light bulb.""
""Well, why don't you tell him he's not?"" asked the startled customer.
""What?"" replied the tailor. ""And then I work in the dark?”"
"After spiritual awakening, how can you focus on something without being separated from consciousness? Because I am moving forward with this journey, but when I focus on something, I feel that I return to the first step","Focusing is concentration which is activities of conscious mind hence focusing essentially means work of consciousness. It has ‘I' as subject and some object. There is duality.
Awareness doesn't have a subject and an object. Awareness simply is.
Consciousness is awareness + thinking (conscious mind).
Then spiritually awakened person shifts between awareness and consciousness. e.g. when he speaks or writes he is thinking, that is he is into consciousness. When he is simply watching, hearing, he is being aware, subject merges into an object. There is no ‘I'."
"If God doesn't want anyone to go to hell, then why did he create hell?","There is no god. There is no heaven or hell. It all springs out of our dualistic nature of mind and universe around us.
Heaven and hell. Day and night. Darkness or Light. Good or bad. God or devil. Truth or lie. Democrat or Republican. etc etc.
Duality is built in the very nature of us. In fact, because of duality we keep moving in circles.
The concept of God is root of all our psychological problems. Once we reject concept of god we will be free and more responsible person.
Then there won't be anyone to blame. Then this question will disappear automatically."
How do you awaken the unconscious genius in your baby?,"It is better to understand what hampers the genius in kids. It is the conditioning of society, religion and morals. Don't give him a religion. Don't set rules of etiquette. In short, let him enjoy the free fall."
To what extent is measuring behaviour a reliable method of measuring consciousness?,"Behaviour is a result of conscience. The conscience is a conditioned mind. Conditioned by morals of society, nation and religion. Any moral person has good behaviour.
Consciousness can be measured on the scale of person's awareness. His awareness of the present moment. His awareness of surroundings. His awareness of persons around him."
Sorry if I m sounding stupid ..I keep reading many experiences of people about third eye and kundalini awakening.How does these change our lives. is it only experience or Is there any greater good by raising our consciousness to this level?,"It is not that spiritual awakening makes you superhuman. It is another way around. The spiritual awakening happens to you when you deserve it. Your intelligence will earn it. Otherwise, it is philosophies like non-duality, I am that or Who am I?
There are three aspects to awakening 1) Karma (body needs to be strong, the weak body can't take it.) 2) Heart ( balanced emotions ) and third is Dhyana (reorganisation of brain patterns or rewiring of the brain). These three aspects make the shift in consciousness possible.
Until and unless there is a shift in your consciousness there will be no spiritual awakening. The spiritual awakening is a trophy of your achievement."
"How can I remain conscious while sleeping, or meditate while sleeping?","This is very old Tibetan method, they have worked very deeply in the dream world and it was extensively used by George Gurdjieff.
Just before falling into sleep try to remember one thing, only one thing, let's say pink rose. Just visualize a pink rose and go on thinking that you will see it in the dream. Visualize it and go on thinking that whatsoever the dream, this pink rose flower will be there. Visualize its colour, scent and everything. Feel it so it will be alive in you.

Within a few days, you will be able to bring it in your dream. This is the first step, you have created at least a part of your dream. The second step the moment you see pink rose you will remember ‘this is a dream. ‘ Now pink rose and dream are associated. Whenever the pink rose appears you will know the dream has started. This will change the whole experience of the dream. You can enjoy the dream. If you want to stop the dream you can stop it but it will take few more days. Once you are able to start and end your dreams then you can start to create your dreams.
Techniques can work with contents but in deep sleep, there is no content so technique won't work with sleep."
"How does one abide in an enlightened state? I have glimpsed awakening, yet I don't feel it now. I can't seem to be able to stop chasing ""the pile of gold"" that is promised and just be still.","If you have glimpsed awakening that is called Satori in Zen. Satori is glimpses of awakening. It is a way to prepare your body and brain for spiritual awakening. Until and unless your body, heart and brain can't take it, it will not happen again.
There are three aspects to awakening 1) Karma (body needs to be strong, the weak body can't take it.) 2) Heart ( balanced emotions ) and third is Dhyana (reorganisation of brain patterns or rewiring of the brain). These three aspects make possible the shift in consciousness.
Until and unless there is a shift in your consciousness there will be no permanent awakening, it will come and go like a flash.
It is not that spiritual awakening makes you superhuman. The spiritual awakening happens to you when you deserve it. Your intelligence will earn it. Otherwise, it is philosophies like non-duality, I am that or Who am I?"
"Why do people think they can find enlightenment through yoga, rather than researching great philosophical or religious texts?","The mind is all doing whereas enlightenment is about non-doing also. Neither only doing nor non-doing alone can help you attain enlightenment. It is combination which works. When Karma yogi, Gyan Yogi and Dhyan Yogi come under one roof then enlightenment happens.
You need healthy body, healthy heart (emotional balance) and healthy mind (dhyan yogi) to reach enlightenment.
No one has ever reached enlightenment being one of three."
What is the mind? Is it a physical form?,"Exactly like the skin is the container of our physical body, the mind is a mental construct. It is a construct to communicate with others. Skin is the outer demarcation and mind is inner demarcation. Mind's ‘I' is known as ego."
Which food helps to silent when Kundalini is awakened from a long sleep?,"Alcohol, sex and meat can silent the kundalini."
"Why is that I have seemed to have reached a saturation point now after reading spiritual texts and listening to spiritual discourses for years together, that I am shunning everything totally?","Clark Tomason has said the truth. Now it is time to unlearn everything and I want to add your desire to know more has already annihilated now you have to destroy what you know and go back and read the Bible, understand the meaning of born again."
What it symbolises seeing 2-3 tigers 🐯 in dream and dogs howling and people and I ofcourse running for help and I climbed tree similar to coconut?,"This is your flight response to the fear of death.
Fear can be the response of flight or fight response of our unconscious mind.
There are two more responses coded in your unconscious mind - freeze and fawn. Freeze is simple to understand but fawn is the when you seek to appease someone who is not nice to you just to avoid further dispute.
Flight and freeze are the main matter of concern here as these are deep-rooted in your unconscious mind and you seem to miss life because of these two responses in fear.
Dissolving fear (traumatic) by visualisation.
This visualisation is very strong if applied and can change your life.
First thing first. Your fear has a visual form in the conscious mind as some animal ( e.g. Leopard) or reptile (e.g. snake) metaphorically.
I am taking Leopard as an example.
Our visualisation will start to show compassion towards leopard and try to befriend with leopard. Give him food to eat. Slowly go closer and touch him and give him some rub.
Then he will start becoming little cub automatically, now you can touch him with more love and then pick it to feed him with a milk bottle. Slowly you will be out of fear. Fear is an absence of love. You struggle with your fear. Make him a friend and you can change friend only.
You need to be a little intelligent while choosing an animal as fear. In your case, it is a tiger 🐯.
With snake also you can feed him milk and in fact, feeding milk to snakes was a normal tradition in ancient India. It is still practised in India. It sets you free of your fear."
"Is there any danger of Samadhi without the guidance of a Guru? I was doing meditation since last 3 months at home after watching YouTube video and yesterday I achieved state of samdhi, I was frightened. Are there any dangers if I don't have a Guru?","There are a whole lot of dangers to attaining samadhi without the master. What you know as samadhi it might be opening of one of the granthis out of three Bharhma, Vishu and Rudra.
These are psychic knots and opening of one of it, your subconscious mind starts to shake your nervous system. You might see visions of serpents or dangerous animals. These vision of animals are a visual representation of your fear of death. It might lead to complex PTSD (POST TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER).
I know people who spent decades blocked at Vishnu Knot. It is a very complex phenomenon and may lead to suicide or extreme near-death experiences.
I guess you have opened the first granthi for few seconds that is why you are shaken. I suggest you stop meditation or contact some therapist otherwise you will continue to face severe fear because kundalini has started travelling upwards. It is very difficult to stop it but it can be stopped right now."
"If spirituality is science, then why does science deny the existence of God?","Spirituality is a science much like a scientific experiment. Scientists have to experiment thousand of time with the hypothesis for invention. But once invention is reached then there are a fixed set of steps. Scientists don't have to reinvent the same thing. The effect is reached then cause is pretty documented.
In spirituality, effects are known but the cause remains unknown. It is a pathless path. e.g. all spiritual enlightenment causes opening of seven chakras but there is no map to open 7 chakras. Even if there is, it will work for one and may not work for others. It is much like reinventing the wheel for every individual and there is no guaranty it will work. One might not attain enlightenment after decades or one may reach in a few years. That is why Buddha said it takes millions of birth to attain enlightenment.
Whereas God is concerned, there is no God. Yes, there are laws of the cosmic plane which govern every aspect of the universe and reside inside of everything in the universe. You can call it God or creator."
"How come Brahma Vishnu Mahesh get created in the universe? Why are they also named as creator, protector, and destroyer respectively?","People have lost the true meaning of Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh (Rudra). These are granthis (psychic knots) in our body which are governed by laws of the cosmic plane we know as God.
There are seven chakras in our subtle body and three granthis (psychic knots) — Brahma, Vishnu and Rudra (Mahesh).
Brahma is a knot at Muladhara chakra which is base of our existence connected to mother earth.
Vishnu is a knot at Anahata (Anahata means unhurt) chakra which represent the heart. Our heart beats that is why we survive. It is a preserver.
Rudra(Mahesh) is a psychic knot at third eye if it is opened then one is bound to open Sahasrara chakra. It is very difficult to open the third eye without the enlightened master. The ego dies if the Sahasrara is opened. That is why Shiva is a destroyer. One attains Moksha. That is why all Hindu break the skull on a funeral. This is just a shortcut. People are not aware that by breaking the skull one is not liberated. One has to open all three psychic knots and then on the opening of Sahasrara chakra one attains Moksha."
I am scared that my third eye will open and I keep focusing on it because I’m anxious. Will this cause the third eye to open?,You are at hara chakra so don't worry it will not open. Before the third eye opening one becomes fearless because of a lot of compassion and forgiveness. One is not scared. You are still the same unconscious.
How did people increase their brain efficiency by meditation?,"The brain shifts its states by generating waves Alpha, Beta, Theta and Delta. The waking state is beta, meditative state is alpha, dreaming state is theta and sleep state is delta.
When one meditates for years he starts to be grounded in Alpha state. This is a more relaxed state of mind then waking. When one starts to slip into Theta more frequently then he starts to have rare insights of everyday activities. Delta state is a state of no-mind. When one can slip into a state of no-mind while waking he starts to have faculty of the beyond this physical realm. Hindus call it Turiya. All spiritual experiences happen in the Turiya. All manifestations at the delta level. There is a good deal of study done by Dr. Silva and Vishen Lakhiani is teaching a framework to enter Alpha, Theta and Delta state of mind. The same principle works behind the law of attraction. You train your subconscious brain to produce delta waves and which cosmic intelligence can understand and your manifestations happen. You can check out Mastering Altered States for Problem Solving & Performance by Vishen Lakhiani Free Masterclass."
Sadhguru says the Theosophical Society tried to create or consecrate a form or being with all the seven chakras at their peak? Is there any mention of this by the theosophical society?,"Annie Besant was a founder of theosophical society. She was very much interested in esoteric practices. It was the main motive of the theosophical society to mass-produce humans like Shiva so that human consciousness can become the most evolved race in the universe.
If you read books of theosophical society about Samadhi you will be blown away. So clear, so precise you won't find anything like that anywhere."
What makes Sadhguru different from Osho and Baba Ramdev?,Please don't compare two enlightened people. Yes for Ramdev I can say don't compare apples with oranges. He is a businessman and pious politician.
Vashikaran is real who best vashikaran specialist in Mumbai and prive?,"Vashikaran is 100% real. There are many planes of existence and there are cosmic laws of each plane, the frequency of every plane varies. We are on a physical plane which has the highest frequency. Other planes have lower frequencies that is why they are invisible to us. The highest plane has the lowest frequency. There is four frequency of brain known to man - alpha, beta, theta and delta.
The waking state is beta, meditative state is alpha, dreaming state is theta and sleep state is delta. One who's the brain can produce theta waves at will is capable of doing Vashikaran."
"If wars can be started by lies, can they be stopped by the truth?","Wars are the clash of egos. A lie doesn't start a war. Lies are the result of struggling ego. Politicians are the most egoist people. They live in ‘I' and Frederick S. Perls called this layer bullshit. Only very sharp, cunning people can survive in politics.
War has positive aspects also, countries who fought many wars are the most developed. All the road, bridges or infrastructure are in this world because of wars.
To stop wars everyone should turn Buddha or at least people should be intelligent enough to choose Buddha as their leader which is impossible because it is impossible to find Buddha and Buddha has got nothing to do with politics.
The situation is the dog chasing his tail. Wars can't be stopped regardless of which lie started the war."
Isn't it still reality that which is beyond reality?,"Our mind's sensory input is capable of seeing positive and the universe has a negative side also which Buddha has called Shunyata. That is why scientists are exploring dark matter, the negative universe of the physical world. That is a world in itself. It is 70% of the universe. Even in the atom there is empty spaces.
Cosmic consciousness records everything in form of binary data. There are cosmic laws of different planes, the frequency of every plane varies. We are on a physical plane which has the highest frequency. It has laws like gravity, light and sound. Other planes have lower frequencies that is why they are invisible to us. The highest plane has the lowest frequency. There is four frequency of brain known to man - alpha, beta, theta and delta.
The waking state is beta, meditative state is alpha, dreaming state is theta and sleep state is delta. There is one more frequency which is called the state of turiya by mystics. Turiya is the state of lowest frequency where all the spiritual experiences happen. The State of turiya connects to the highest plane of existence - cosmic consciousness."
Why does the conscious act of doing meditation become the biggest obstacle in attaining a meditative state of mind?,"This question reminds me of the beautiful Tibetan parable.
An old saint knew how to fly and he became very famous. A young man got interested in knowing the secret. He swore that he would devote his whole life to know the secret to flying. He started to live with the old saint.
………
After a few months, tired of the young man, because twenty-four hours a day he was there…Finally the old man got fed up. He told the young fellow, “Today I am going to tell you the secret. It is not very difficult. It is very simple.”
He said, “Everything is hidden in the mantra —Om mani Padme hum.”
The young man said, “ Don't fool me. This is the mantra everbody knows.”
The old saint said, “ I am going to give you the secret key to open this mantra nobody knows.”
The young man said, “Key? I have never heard that there is a key to open the mantra.”
“The key is, while you are repeating the mantra – just for three minutes – don’t let any monkey pop into your head.”
The young man said, “You seem to be an old idiot! In my whole life, I have never thought of a monkey. Why should I think of one?”
He rushed down the stairs of the temple where the old saint lived. But strangely, even though he was not chanting the mantra, monkeys started coming. He would close his eyes and they would be there. He would run to this side and they would be there. They were not outside, they were inside his head. As far as he could see, only monkeys and monkeys.
Somehow he tried to sleep but all night monkeys kept crowding his head and the house.
By the morning he was so tired that he rushed to the old saint and said, “Please take away your key. I am almost mad!”
The old man said, “That’s why I was not telling anybody because the key is very difficult. Now, do you understand why I was silent? Now it is almost impossible to take back the key.”
He said, “I don’t want to listen to a single word from you. You just take this key back and let me go home. And I don’t want these monkeys to follow me!”
The man dropped the mantra, he dropped the key. He closed his eyes and there was no monkey. He looked all around and there was no monkey. He tried just once on the way, to see what happens when he says Om mani Padme hum and closes his eyes. And they were all coming, from all directions.
The very idea of doing meditation becomes a monkey. Never force any thought to go away; otherwise, it will rebound with greater energy. And the energy is yours! You are on a self-defeating track. The more you throw it away the more it will come back.
If the idea of doing meditation comes just say “Hi”. Be a friend to the idea and by becoming friends you can change someone not by being enemy. By being enemy mind starts playing ego games. It struggles with the idea and thinking loop starts that never ends and meditation never happens."
What really made Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar to get converted into Budhist from Hindu?,"Any intelligent person can't believe in fictitious God. There is no place of God in Buddhism. But Doctor Ambedkar opted Buddhism for two reasons. One there is no caste system in Buddhism. Two concept of God was not appealing to Dr Ambedkar.
I was watching a program there was a mass conversion of the Hindus into Buddhism. It was Dr Ambedker who gave new life to Buddhism in India. Buddhism was eliminated from India and it took a new form of Zen in China, Burma and Japan. Zen is a merger of Tao and Buddhism.
But in my view, either one should completely deny religion or accept his religion wholeheartedly. Because conversion to other religion creates a split personality.
I think all religions are prison. How can prison made of gold is better than prison made of iron? Born Christian and die Buddhist doesn't work. It is thinking loop. It doesn't matter how beautiful is your prison it can't make you free. Freedom is where there is no religion or God."
Are habits and spirituality correlated? What factors measure this correlation?,"The Habit of meditation is related to spirituality. All other habits are either natural human drives or egocentric.
Going to temple or praying is also business of give and take. Everything you do in the name of spirituality is the way of mind and spirituality is to attain no-mind. Transcending the mind and experiencing the true-self.
Whenever someone used to ask Buddha non-existential question, Buddha's answer used to be “Just meditate” or simply he won't answer."
How is Hara related to the 7 chakras?,"Hara is exactly 2 inches below the navel. This is where the second chakra Svadhisthana chakra or sacral chakra resides. This is also called Hara chakra. Hara chakra is related to fear of death. When you overcome the fear of death then your Hara chakra is opened. Hara chakra is the cause of flight or fight response of the person. Hoarding (more and many of everything) is also one of the responses of Hara chakra.
In Japan Samurai used to commit suicide by stabbing at Hara in the name of pride. This is the most painless method to kill oneself."
"Would you explain how to get to the state of samadhi in simple, nontechnical terms? How do we train our minds to reach samadhis?","I call my meditation Automeditation. Here we try to rewire subconscious mind to be a witness/observer.
Start by waking up in the morning and go to open space like a park and find a place sit comfortably, close your eyes and hear to the chirping of the birds everyday same time same place till you easily meditate for at least 45 minutes.
This will rewire your brain to go into meditation easily automatically that is why I call it Automeditation.
Once you are ready for the next step start witnessing your body actions all day.
Start to witness your emotions whenever there is a sudden change in emotion all day.
Start to witness your thought in the morning meditation.
Slowly, slowly you will start to become witness (Sakshi) to everything. When you witness your thoughts there is a gap between two thoughts that is where meditation happens. If you keep meditating, these gaps will become bigger and bigger and one fine day one of the gaps will become permanent. This is called samadhi- state of no-mind - turiya."
Isn’t it a boggling of our minds that we open wine shops and for the opening of temples we have to resort to agitations? We are materialistic in our minds and actions.,"There is no difference between starting a wine shop or a temple. It all boils down to both deal in the insanity of the human mind.
Both make the human mind unconscious. Wine shop charges you for physical thing and temple charges you for an invisible thing called God. Something that doesn't exist.
You hope God will solve your problems and your mind remains a businessman all your life. You waste money in the name of rituals.
In fact God is the root of our mental illness. It is the invention of the primitive mind. People who lived all their lives remaining slave to their mind. Our ancestors were very simple people and our mind has grown too complex. If we live like our ancestors we shall have split personality. All the neurosis happens because of the concept of god."
"Is the universe a developing brain of an organism, which records, stores information and processes information like a Computer?","Much like us, the universe has cosmic consciousness. We have individual consciousness which is a part of cosmic consciousness. That is why there is a collective consciousness.
When there is cosmic consciousness then, of course, there is the cosmic heart and cosmic brain which records everything in form of binary data. That is why scientists are exploring dark matter, the negative universe of the physical world.
We are a copy of cosmic entity some call it a God. There are cosmic laws of different planes, the frequency of every plane varies. We are on a physical plane which has the highest frequency. Other planes have lower frequencies that is why they are invisible to us. The highest plane has the lowest frequency. There is four frequency of brain known to man - alpha, beta, theta and delta.
The waking state is beta, meditative state is alpha, dreaming state is theta and sleep state is delta. There is one more frequency which is called the state of turiya by mystics. Turiya is the state of lowest frequency where all the spiritual experiences happen. The State of turiya connects to the highest plane of existence - cosmic consciousness."
"Sadhguru Jagadish Vasudev says he was born as a ""Shivayogi"" in his past life. Do ""Shivayogis"" exist? Where are ""Shivayogis"" now? Is there any reliable or reasonable proof, evidence, information, about existence of ""Shivayogis""?","This is an identity crisis and even if this is true it doesn't make much sense. Why one should be concerned about him. What has it got to do with your life? I don't see any reasonable reason to be concerned about him and more particularly his past lives. Listen to what he has to say now if it helps you then take it or leave it.
One thing you must understand that there is no god. Even if there is a god there is no way to know him. How will you recognise him? Is he like Shiva or Krishna or naked Mahavira. How will you know? Maybe you meet him every day but can't recognise him. Who knows?
If you need proof and evidence then you should believe in the existence. Why believe in stories. You better watch Netflix. There are many interesting series or go to Amazon to buy Harry Potter. That is going to make you happy. Don't be Alice in Wonderland."
How can you confirm if someone is really possessed?,"What people know as possession of spirit or some devil is energy blockage at the heart chakra. The dissonance between conscious mind and unconscious mind causes personality split. Similar condition can go on for years or maybe for full life.
Even if one is pretending that is also disease. You can be sure there is a serious mental condition which requires psychotherapy immediately. Don't ignore it, get it cured before this becomes second nature."
Why do almost all 'enlightened thinkers' such as Eckhart tolle and Sadhguru only seem to 'tour' the USA? Following the money? Following the gullible? Or helping the most ego centric nation?,"Simply they are not enlightened. They are self-realised. They know their true-self. Enlightenment and self-realisation are rungs of the same ladder. Some stop at self-realisation like Jainas think self-realisation is the end. But there is a one-step more to Enlightenment. Let's understand.
When a drop falls into the ocean and merges it is self-realization.
When the ocean falls into a drop that is enlightenment.
In self-realisation ‘I' remains and that is why a self-realised person turns into pious egoist. Ambitions and desires remain.
Kabir, Buddha were enlightened. These all are self-realised and their journey stopped there maybe someday they will be enlightened and realise the futility of all their efforts."
"I don't believe in God or religion, but I am also not against any religion. I keep my views to myself and don't mock other religions. Is there a term for that?",You believe but pretend not to believe.
"Is ""cosmic consciousness"" real?","This universe is an expansion of energy and life is the crystallization of the same energy. What we see as matter, what we experience as thoughts and consciousness - all are a manifestation of the same energy infinite forms.

The conscious mind is active and we use the conscious and subconscious mind in day to day activities, below it we have an unconscious mind where our conscious mind stores memories, knowledge as memory blocks and retrieves it on demand of conscious/subconscious mind.
Still one level down we have a collective unconscious mind which is part of our society/political ideology and religion.
One more level down we have a cosmic unconscious mind which includes all of the earth- animals, rocks, mountains. It is a universal mind or cosmic mind - an order of disorder before this creation or re-creation.
Once one attains samadhi, then awareness dips down to the cosmic unconscious mind and consciousness shoots up to superconsciousness, collective consciousness and cosmic consciousness.
You need to go deeper into roots to grow to highest by meditating.
It happens like this your awareness goes deeper to roots and your consciousness starts climbing the ladder upwards to the cosmic consciousness.
Much like cosmic consciousness, there is a cosmic heart of existence."
Does the unconscious mind exist without the conscious mind or vice versa?,"The unconscious mind exists regardless of the conscious mind. Both work independently. There are three types of activities action, inaction and non-action - karma, akarma and vikarma.
Action is the way of conscious mind where you direct your action as a doer or ‘I'. Suppose if you are holding a pen you have to make effort to drop it. This is action. You are acting as a doer.
Inaction is the way of the subconscious mind where everything becomes automatic and you don't act as ‘I'. There is doing but no doer. Like driving, brushing your teeth or doing something which has become your habit. There is no doer but things happen.
Non-action is the way of the unconscious mind where neither is doer nor doing but things are happening like breathing, digestion, heartbeats even if you try not to breathe you can't stop it for long.
The unconscious mind works independently of your conscious mind. That is why people in coma live for decades.
Conscious mind can't exist without an unconscious mind at least not cognitively."
How does one discover their true self?,"There are six layers of the ego (personality) around true-self and when we meditate for many years the layers are peeled like peeling an onion.
Frederick S. Perls has listed six layers of ego in his book :- Ego, Hunger, and Aggression.
Here are list of layers :-
Layer one : In this people live artificial life like if they go to funeral they cry with others but their tears mean nothing. They say Hello but to avoid people. This layer is called CHICKENSHIT.
Layer two : This layer is pure ego. It is like - I AM PRESIDENT OF AMERICA. I AM HUSBAND OF MISS UNIVERSE. People in this layer are bit better than layer one but dangerous because they become politicians, police officers etc.This layer is called BULLSHIT.
Layer three: When something bad happens in layer two like death of loved one or divorce then people like poets, authors, musicians, lyricists or people good at heart fall to third layer. This layer is called CHAOS. Here people either become alcoholic or druggist or go back to layer two.If one remains meditative and aware then he enters next layer.
Layer four: This is DEATH layer ,where you touch death experiences of yourself and your loved one.If one remains aware in this layer by meditating then he or she enters LIFE phase. To be frank, in this layer you need a MASTER who can give birth to your new ego otherwise you will move like zombie or you will revert to layer two.When this layer is being peeled this is Awakening of Heart Chakra. This is also called 'night of the soul'. This term was first mentioned in a poem written by the 16th-century Spanish mystic and poet St. John of the Cross. From here you are most likely to descend or transcend. Be careful and remain aware. This space is to help you understand this phase and aftereffects.
Layer five: This layer is called LIFE. Your new ego has to take new form and new dimensions of a loving and compassionate life. You can become Epicurious or Buddha if you remain aware. From here MASTER can't help you. You will be guided by your wisdom.
Layer SIX: This layer is called BLISS. If you come to this layer then you have the possibility of becoming BUDDHA- full of pure love and awareness.
Break the shell of every layer before you experience first SATORI and then true-self."
People who believe that humans have only one life live life desperately while people who believe in reincarnation live with laziness. What's the correct way to approach life?,"Irrespective of what you think one should live here and now. Never let negative emotions become your master. Never be desperate to the desires of bodily pleasures. Always share positive things with people you love or people who love you without strings. Never try to be someone else.
When you live in now you become spontaneous you become yourself not someone else. This very moment is all that matters. People who live in past or future miss life. They postpone and tomorrow never comes. They live unconsciously. They live trying to be someone else.
A Refresher:-
A man went into a tailor's shop and saw a man hanging by one arm from the centre of the ceiling.
""What is he doing there?"" he asked the tailor.
""Oh, pay no attention,"" said the tailor, ""he thinks he's a light bulb.""
""Well, why don't you tell him he's not?"" asked the startled customer.
""What?"" replied the tailor. ""And work in the dark?”"
"When Kundalini awakened accidentally, should it be positioned by an expert person?","Kundalini awakened accidentally can be very dangerous. One is likely to move like a zombie for decades and not knowing the root cause of the problem. It can be dangerous to the extent of suicide.
Only one who has traveled the path and is enlightened can be of help. He knows how to untie all three knots or granthis -brahma, vishnu and rudra.
These are psychic knots and sometimes it may take many lives to resolve. People are reincarnated just because of these knots. One who resolves these three knots attains Nirvana."
"Is consciousness one as many gurus are saying or multiple? If multiple, what are the multiples?","Cosmic consciousness is one. Each one of us has individual consciouness connected to cosmic consciousness.
This is how we all are connected to each other nothing is individual. Experience of this oneness with whole is enlightenment.
Cosmic consciousness is heart of existence exactly like each one of us has heart.
Self-realisation is knowing your true-self and enlightenment is when one's heart starts beating in resonance with the heartbeat of the existence.
PS: Awareness is consciousness minus mind. Awareness is absolute without any doer. Consciousness has doer as mind's 'I'."
Do eyes speak?,"Eyes are reflexion of your inner state. When you are peaceful you will blink your eyes less.
When you are confused you will blink your eyes frequently.
When you are in shock your eyes will be stoned.
When you dream your eyes move faster and when you are in deep sleep your eyes will hardly move.
Eyes are connected to your conscious mind and conscious mind hands over the all sensory information to subconscious mind and subconscious mind makes sense of objects you see.
It is said, Buddha's eyes were so silent that looking in his eyes once could change one forever. His eyes remained so beautiful till his death at the age of 83.
Eyes tell your inner state of mind."
Why are some born with high intelligence?,"Everybody is born intelligent. No one is born more or less intelligent. Intelligence lies in the understanding your subconscious mind and conscious mind.
When one doesn't understand his natural drives then a split is created in his personality and one tends to become dumber and dumber day by day.
One who understands his natural drives he becomes more and more intelligent.
e.g. If you want to have sex with a girl and you try to persuade her pretending that you love her and this acting will create a split in your personality you will become well-versed actor not lover. Now being an actor is the last thing one should try to do in real life."
Does Kundalini help to communicate with your subconscious mind?,"Yes, Third eye is also called Agya chakra , Agya means permission. Agya chakra is connected to subconscious mind.Whatsoever is accepted through Agya chakra becomes part of subconscious mind.
It is said Geeta was directly transferred to Arjuna through Agya chakra to his subconscious mind by Krishna much like memory dump. It sounds little absurd that in the middle of Mahabharata battle Krishna and Arjuna talking for hours and rest of warriors wondering what is happening.
When your Agya chakra is operating then you can wire and rewire your subconscious mind. Subconscious mind has infinite possibilities. Look at following comparison of conscious and subconscious mind.

Can dead nerve of human body brought back to life?,"The flow of energy through dead nerves is controlled by your unconscious mind.
Certainly it can be restored by the person who's kundalini is awakened and he would need few minutes to restore dead nerves as he can pass cosmic energy in abundance through kundalini or chakras and dead nerve will be restored. It is something like overhauling of energy system with new energy source. All the problems lie in unconscious mind of the person where all the basic functions of body are controlled like breathing, blood pressure, heart beats, digestion etc.
Direct access to unconscious mind also gives access to all seven chakras of body and once it is accessed it can be cured.Modern medical science can't explain this but any mystic can do it on fly."

"If we stop drinking beer, can we open our third eye?","Beer is better than opening third eye. Just slip into enjoyment of beer. Just swim in beer.
Seriously desire to open third eye and desire to have few pint of Heineken Lager Beer is same but desire to open third eye is deeper emptiness of yourself.
Understand that emptiness which is making you crippled. The very understanding of the desire to open third eye will set you free of all the sufferings you are going through. Maybe in that relaxation you will have deeper insight of your problem."
Are moderate to heavy smokers at higher risk to contract Coronavirus?,No but risk of death is highest once it is there in system of a heavy smoker and recovery can be very slow.
How does the subconscious mind influence the conscious mind?,"Subconscious mind has hard wired survival responses. Fight or flight , love or hate, jealousy or compassion, sad or happy. Value system of subconscious mind is based on emotions.
Conscious mind decodes these responses of subconscious mind into thoughts and tries to make sense in physical world and chooses rational option.
Conscious mind value system is based on rational interpretation of experience."
How does the guru manage to save his disciples’ lives?,"Guru can help you to awake and live life in present consciously, alert. Most of accidents happen because of unconscious living.
If you are talking of guru as savior then that is unreasonable expectation. There is no God as savior what to talk about Guru as savior."
"Is knowing all the answers a sign of enlightenment, and if one does not, does it mean they aren't awakened yet?","Absolutely No.
Knowing answers has two dimensions. e.g. Atheist says there is no god. He is saying it without knowing himself unconsciously.
And when an enlightened person says he says there is no God he is saying consciously after owing his true-self.
Both knowing is same but one is out of unconsciousness and other is out of consciouness.
Everybody has answers to every question according to his experiences. I have not seen single person who doesn't have point of view.
Quality of answers determines the state of the person. If answers of the person disturb you then you can be sure person is enlightened and if you find answers witty and exhilarating then person is speaking from your level only and hence he is not enlightened."
What are some paranormal experiences that left you shaken?,"Paranormal experiences are illusions of crippled mind. There is no paranormal activity. When our mind doesn't understand something that is called paranormal.
One thing you should get straight - your mind is paranoid and there is no paranormal events. Your mind is cause of all your illusions. Your mind always asks for something supernatural that is why you love movies of superhumans like superman,spiderman and batman.
It is requirements of your mind to look out for something like god. God is also result of your paranoid mind. You seem to believe everything which satisfies your fascination of God.
In fact God is the cause of all your foolish questions and answers you get are always illusions. Concept of God is the root of all your problems and illusions."
"If you become a ghost, which organization (and building) do you want to haunt?","Ghost , devil or even God are man invented terms and it stems from the very nature of mind. Mind works on duality when you believe God then you are bound to believe in ghosts. God is positive ghost and ghost is negative God.
Mind is full of questions like this and it has no meanings in real life. Try to be more conscious about monkey questions like this."
I started to meditate two weeks ago and still I feel there is no change or any feelings of meditation on me. Am I doing the meditation in the wrong way or does it happen for all?,"Don't make goal of meditation. If you make a goal of meditating longer then your ego will make it an ambition and you will struggle meditating for longer , you will be frustrated.
Meditation is non-doing. Doing is a way of moving out. Non-doing is a way of moving in to the centre of your being.
The trick to meditate is to become observer of mind.Meditation starts by being separate from the mind, by being a witness of mind. e.g. When you look at mirror , you will only see your face if there is a distance between your face and mirror, if mirror is too close to your face you won't be able to see your face. Likewise when you become observer/witness of mind then a gap is created between mind and witness/observer/watcher.
Watching is the key of meditation. Watch your mind. Don’t do anything – no repetition of mantra, no repetition of the name of god- As you watch, slowly mind becomes empty of thoughts; but you are not falling asleep, you are becoming more alert, more aware.
As the mind becomes completely empty.Just by watching, you immediately get out of the mind.
While witnessing there will be gaps between any two thoughts and as you keep meditating these gaps will become larger and larger and one day gap will become permanent - this is called Samadhi."
"What is the difference between the mind and the brain? Are they the same, or is the mind just a metaphor of the mind?","Mind is 'I' the 'self' which is based on duality - this and that, they and us, you and me. Mind is ego which believes world revolves around mind's 'I'. Mind is framework of fight or flight.
Whereas brain is physical organ just like computer having central processing unit (CPU) , random access memory ( Internal RAM) and a SSD (Solid state drive) for storage much like modern smartphone.
CPU is conscious mind , RAM is subconscious mind and memories are stored on SSD."
"People on the spiritual practices say that they want to know/realise the ultimate truth, but what truth are they talking about?","Whatsoever you think you are, you are not. You are not doctor, engineer, mother, daughter or introvert, extrovert or this is all your ego- your mind's 'I'.
Truth is you are beyond your mind's 'I' - the eternal - one who never dies or borns."
Is the soul of Sushant Singh Rajput resting in peace?,"When there is no God then there is no point in thinking of soul. Mind weaves stories according to his ego. Nothing remains after death only your DNA is transferred. Yes , you can call your DNA soul or any other fancy name you may like.
He missed the opportunity to be enlightened. He could have got enlightened. When your mind is killed it is called enlightenment and when your mind kills your body it is called suicide.
All the people who commit suicide have greatest potential to be enlightened. But sadly they get killed by their mind.
Existence always tries to save the one who tries to commit suicide and the ultimate manifestation of its efforts to save one is to awaken him."
What lies ahead of humankind after Kalyug?,"There is no such thing as kalyug. Time is man invented measurement to keep track of events or memories. Animals don't use wrist watch.
Time is a concept and only present and eternity exists.Mind is past and future. Mind is time, memories and history.
Concept of month and week is as old as human race and it is actually based on four moon phases. Moon is as important to humans as sun is.The Moon takes 27.3 days to orbit Earth, but the lunar phase cycle (from new Moon to new Moon) is 29.5 days. The Moon spends the extra 2.2 days ""catching up"" because Earth travels about 45 million miles around the Sun during the time the Moon completes one orbit around Earth. It comes to 30 days hence the month.
Yugas are the way of mind and life is here and now."
Is it possible for a human being to attain eternal bliss?,"Only human being are capable of attaining eternal bliss. Animals and birds are pre-programmed they have definite map. There is no possibility for them to attain freedom.
Only humans have consciouness that is why humans can choose to be happy or sad. They are free to live unconsciously like birds and animals or they can choose to be blissful.
Enlightenment is eternal blissfulness. Ultimate flowering of human being is enlightenment. Enlightenment is freedom from prison of mind. It is attaining to full potential of human being.
Without enlightenment man remains slave to mind. Lisa Cron in her book - “ Wired for story” has given brain science behind fantasy island of mind. We remain wired for stories without enlightenment. That is why we love fictions, movies and that is why we have more than 300 useless religions and thousands of wars. Mind invented thousands of God. Concept of God is root cause of human miseries.
Enlightenment is a quantum leap - from mind to no-mind. It is cessation of mind as master. It is the end of sufferings."
Do we take rebirth or reincarnation?,"Rebirth/reincarnation is reality. God can not be proved but we have many proofs of reincarnation according to surveys conducted by many.
Now quantum physics also agrees with theory of reincarnation.
Scientifically, mind is vibrations (beta,alpha,theta,delta). Mind is whole life's accumulated desires, his whole life's accumulated memories, his whole life's karmas.
When a person dies, the body disappears, the material part disappears, but the immaterial part, the mind part, pure energy. That vibration is released, broadcast. Now, wherever a right womb is ready for this vibe, it will enter into the womb.
Human can reborn infinite times till he attains Nirvana/moksha he will reborn as human only."
Why should one be an enlightened human being?,"Ultimate flowering of human being is enlightenment. Enlightenment is freedom from prison of mind. It is attaining to full potential of human being.

Enlightenment is a quantum leap - from mind to no-mind. It is cessation of mind as master. It is end of sufferings. It is going beyond concept of religion and God."
Why do the spiritually advanced ones eat less?,"Primarily eating habits are formed because of two reasons one is basic habit of accumulation and second is basic habit of trying variety. These two drives are very nature of our mind. Man applies these two drives in every walk of life from food to sex.
One who starts to live life of minimal becomes spiritual and everything starts to make sense in its own context. Food becomes just necessity not luxury for spiritual person."
"Can anybody answer ""Who am I"" means who we really are?","“who am I ?” Is your quest , your path to know yourself. I am not politicians, I am not yogi, I am not engineer, I am not my name.
I am beyond my name. I am beyond mind.
I am eternal. I am emptiness. I am void. I know the unknowable. I am that is why this world exists.
You are here because existence needs you."
I had to give up my dreams for my elder sibling. Now my family doesn't recognize my sacrifice in fact discriminates it. I feel like I cheated myself. What should I do?,"Giving up dreams ?? You gave up something which was not. In fact you have not given up your desire, you have postponed it and shadow of it is there as desire to be appreciated as great man of sacrifice. It is still haunting you that is why you feel cheated.
You just have to understand whole idea of goal is illusionary. Life is mystery to be lived not the goal to achieve. Just live life as it comes there is nowhere to go just live here and now."
What is your message to Rhea Chakraborty and Mahesh Bhatt?,They will celebrate New year together. Happy new year 2021…..
Why do I feel inferior to people who have good English speaking skills? How can I get myself talk to such people?,"Problem is not english speaking skill, problem is your nature of comparing yourself to others. Somehow your desire to speak fluent english is root cause of your inferiority complex.
You should understand that everyone is unique. Existence is bad photocopier. You should understand everyone has a story behind him. People are interested in sharing positive things. If you start speaking your heart people will be interested in knowing you."
Is reading kalma/Islamic word against Hinduism rules? If one read/say for casually or occassionally? One of my friend read it and she read it with faith while others say that it's against Hinduism.,"There is no difference in two religions. They are all same.
Every religion is prison. Every religion is prison of words and stories. 300 religions on earth each thinking it is ultimate. Religions are the work of primitive minds.
Just see how religion is making you guilty of reading beautiful words. All religions have given us crippled consciouness.
Once you understand there is no God you will be freed from prison of religion."
What is the sign of all the chakras being opened and activated?,"Chakras are always activated in unconscious mind. Chakras are working that is why you are alive. It is matter of being able to touch unconscious mind and feel the chakras and once you can feel the chakras then you can control the flow of energy through chakra.
Hindus say nothing in this world is created, everything is already there it is a matter of discovering it."
"Is life after spiritual enlightenment boring? Do you lose the capacity for all the things that made life meaningful as a person such as fear, excitement, romance, passion etc because you realize reality is an insubstantial illusion of a single self?","Life after enlightenment remains same but perspective changes. How would one live his life ?
Life without God.
Life without fear.
Life without being slave to desires.
It is a taste of deathlessness. It is like living in garden of Eden.
Boring, passion are the word of mind. He remains in no-mind. It is God's state."
"According to Hinduism, why only actions are in our hand but not the result in spite of giving our full effort? Does our past life actions effect our results?","First the second part of the question!
There is no past lives. In fact there is no God. It is a strategy to make you feel guilty. It is strategy of priests and politicians to keep you confused.
Now the first part of the question.
The statement is truth. There are thousands of variables to any event so it is impossible to predict the outcome. Philosophy of doer is flawed because nobody is doer in this world everybody is just witness in this world. Do you do things you do or situations force you to do things you do? This is the matter of introspection.
Did you choose to come in this world or you came that's why you asked this question.
Nobody in this world is doer we all are witness to this world and assuming this world revolves around us. We are misinformed egos. We are because this world exists not this world is because of us."
I too lost my dad. How do I digest the pain? How does life move on? How do you change for this?,"It is great revelation that you should become a person who loves everybody. We become sad on death of loved one because we miss the moments we could have shared with him. We become sad because we know that we won't meet him again and say sorry to him for ignoring him when he needed us the most. He always loved us and we always treated him as means. We are sad because we had been selfish not giving time to him and lived unconsciously always in dreams of this and that.
It is a great lesson that life is short share it the most with people who love you unconditionally."
"What is the actual meaning of enlightenment, and how does an enlightened one differ from a genius?","Enlightenment means permanent cessation of mind as master. Mind can be called on demand and subconscious mind becomes the nature of Enlightened being. It is kind of swap between conscious mind and subconscious mind.
In other words ego dissolves and now there is no mind's 'I'. It is transcendence of mind once and forever.
Life of enlightened being is rooted in no-mind or pure consciousness and life of genius is rooted in brilliance of mind. Both belong to diametrically different realms."
"I want to start an Instagram page for daily news and facts. I need a Sanskrit name for the page like 'unbiased citizen, blank paper, developing mind' type. What are some suggestions?","White Paper
News vs Bias
News vs opinions
Out of rabbit holes
White thinking hat"
"If kundalini full awakened, can it cure any disease?","Absolutely YES.
Kundalini awakening heals diseases like hypertension, kidney or galbalader stones, insomnia or any problem related to brain, migraine, liver problems.hair fall ,eyesight problems. It also minimizes the possibility of cancer.
Kundalini awakening completely changes the energy system of your body. All your sexual energy is utilised in the healing of your body functions.
All sensory information is accessed by subconscious mind directly without mediator (conscious mind).
Only downside of Kundalini awakening is the physical strength doesn't remain same as prana energy starts traveling upward and consciouness is stretched all over the body. What is good for consciouness is bad for body.There should be great deal of diet control to maintain balance between apana and prana energy.
PS : Most of the health problems happen because of overuse of mind and all therapies and healings work with issues related to mind and on kundalini awakening one attains no-mind , mind becomes utilitarian not master hence the improvement in health and wellness happens. Kundalini energy can't cure problem related to teeth, bones,infections and allergies."
"I sometimes feel that what is happening right now has happened to me before. Have you ever felt anything like this? If yes, what do you think about it and according to you what could be the reasons behind it?","This is a flashback from prevoius life also called Deja Vu. The situation seems familiar but you can't recall because this situation has something to do with previous life.
In previous life you must have been in same situation and memory of that is buried in unconscious mind. Your consciouness can relate but your mind can't remember."
Are rituals really meaningful?,"Rituals are invention of primitive mind. It is sort of occupation for mind. It gives satisfaction to your ego of being religious. The rituals are kind of going to shopping and buying new clothes and satisfy your desire, the desire to look beautiful for social approval. This polishes your ego.
Doing is the way of mind and your true-self resides in no-mind."
Can a person who is an addict or a smoker move towards spirituality in their daily life?,"Smoking and spirituality has no relation. Smoker or addict can be spiritual or rather they have strong motivation and bigger scope for improvement. Highly moral people remain egoistic thus they have hard time getting concept of egolessness.
Addicts become addicts because they are very good at heart and they don't fit in this cunning world. I have never seen bad alcoholic person. The habit of smoking, drinking and any addiction is bad because they make one unconscious. But the person who takes all sort of excuses like alcohol or smoking to forget this world is generally kind hearted people.
One problem all alcoholic or addicts face is guilt of being the way they are. But if one starts his life from today and doesn't remember past then anyone can come out clean and once he will taste the joy of meditation then he will not need intoxication."
"Do we have to seek Guru, or s/he will appear only when we are ready?","The one who seeks will find the master sooner or later. The master appears if he is sought. Those who sit do not find him.
Those who go on the quest are sure to find master. And remember, it is very difficult to come to the right door, doors have to be knocked on.
One has to wander into the wrong market in search of the right. Also this is essential stage of discovery. When you search, you will find that those who were wrong also gave support.Even identifying the wrong as wrong becomes a step to identify the right as the right.
The moment your eyes meet the eyes of right master there will be no delay. There is no need of words just eyes meet eyes and your soul is illuminated. There is no need to force things. It will be joy of freefall.
Meeting of the master is like love at first sight. Like sudden clash of thunders. Like meeting your lost lover.
This is pure love and all love bring you into this world; This love leads you beyond this world. This is the culmination of love. And all the love, eventually brings you down on the body;This love takes you beyond the body. And all love is gross; This love is subtle.
And the day you find master, your all questions start dissolving and utter silence surrounds you. You become one with the master.
You enter the world of silence."
Are memories a man-made product?,"There is no such thing as memories and time. Time is man invented measurement to keep track of events or memory. Animals don't use wrist watch.
Time is a concept and only present and eternity exist.Mind is past and future. Mind is time, memories and history.
Concept of month and week is as old as human race and it is actually based on four moon phases.

Memories are the way of mind and life is here and now."
What happens when the third eye chakra opens? Are there any side effects?,"If there is blockage at Agya (third eye) chakra then it might leave you blind permanently. Let's see why :-
When kundalini energy rises from heart chakra to Agya chakra then to burn area around (shell) pineal gland (pineal gland is physical organ in brain corresponding third eye) energy from two eyes is also withdrawn to make skull in front of pineal gland transparent. If the energy from two eyes is withdrawn excessively, then there is chance of permanent blindness.
Awakening of Sahasara chakra is also painful but not dangerous. Awakening of Sahasara causes severe pain in the back of skull on Full Moon Night ( because of full gravitation pull of moon).
But trust me if you can achieve this, it is worth sacrificing life."
Can a crown chakra be open before opening of the third eye?,"Absolutely no.
When kundalini energy rises from heart chakra to Agya chakra then to burn area around (shell) pineal gland (pineal gland is physical organ in brain corresponding third eye) energy from two eyes is also withdrawn to make skull in front of pineal gland transparent. If the energy from two eyes is withdrawn excessively, then there is chance of permanent blindness.
Awakening of Sahasara chakra is also painful but not dangerous. Awakening of Sahasara causes severe pain in the back of skull on Full Moon Night ( because of full gravitation pull of moon).
But trust me if you can achieve this, it is worth sacrificing life.
It is suggested to experiment with kundalini under enlightened master - the one who has already travelled the path."
How can a stage hypnotist bypass the critical factor and give suggestions to a person?,"Stage hypnotists work with your subconscious mind directly. Any suggestion given bypasses the critical conscious mind. Subconscious mind takes whatever suggestion is planted in it directly without questions.
Experienced hypnotist goes one level deeper and works with your unconscious mind where all your body functions are controlled like breathing, blood pressure and mechanism of consciousness.
Tantra and black magick goes even deeper to collective unconscious mind and can work with your DNA programming."
Does a person awakened continue for many incarnations or is it required to awaken again?,"The cycle of birth and death continues because of desires. Awakened person becomes desireless instinctively.
Awakening means freedom from cycle of birth and death. Nirvana means blowing off the flame of desires hence there is no reason for reincarnation. Nirvana ends the journey of being human."
Has anyone had an encounter with a ghost in real life?,"Ghost , devil or even God are man invented terms and it stems from the very nature of mind. Mind works on duality when you believe God then you are bound to believe in ghosts. God is positive ghost and ghost is negative God.
Mind is full of questions like this and it has no meanings in real life. You need to be more alert about monkey questions like this."
"If we don't remember our previous birth, then why do we have to suffer the bad deeds of previous birth?","We suffer because of desires not because bad deeds of previous birth. The cycle of birth and death continues because of desires.
Nirvana means blowing out flame of desires. Once one attains Nirvana he is freed from the cycle of birth and death.
There are no good and bad deeds. The concept of good and bad stems out of the very nature of duality of our mind.
Tantra says whatsoever your consciouness allows is good and whatsoever creates split in your being is bad. Tantra accepts you as you are.
People can't live this life consciously what to talk about past lives.
A Refresher:-
A man went into a tailor's shop and saw a man hanging by one arm from the center of the ceiling.
 ""What is he doing there?"" he asked the tailor.
 ""Oh, pay no attention,"" said the tailor, ""he thinks he's a light bulb.""
 ""Well, why don't you tell him he's not?"" asked the startled customer.
 ""What?"" replied the tailor. ""And work in the dark?”"
Why am I not getting any positive results in my life in spite of daily praying to God and donating money to needy people?,"First of all get one thing straight - there is no God. So there is no point of prayers.
Even if you don't donate money this world will keep moving. If you want something in return while helping poor then all you are doing is business.
Your very desires are the reason for your miserable situation. Life is beautiful if you just let go your very desires.
For happy life follow:-
=> Live here and now forget past and future.
=> Turn your negative emotions into positive like gratitude, compassion and forgiveness.
=> Share positive things with people you love.
=> Forego ego and always speak your heart."
What miracles can happen in your life by chanting the 'Hare Krishna' Maha Mantra?,"Nothing will happen. Chant it one thousand and one times and come back to Quora to ask why isn't it working.
Mantra is just a occupation of mind. You better go for walk. You better listen to your favourite music.
No matter what you chant you can chant coca cola coca cola it won't make any difference.
Mantra are invention of primitive mind. Don't waste your time."
Each one of us have different experiences and based on it we form an idea of reality and believe in it. Does reality exist or is it just an illusion?,"This world is real but our perceptions are not real. This world is called Maya (illusion) by Hindus. It is illusion because we only see what we want to see. It is fantasy because we are interested in - “ what's in it for me.” That why Hindus call it Rasleela.
Only self-realised person can see the world as it is because he has transcended duality of mind. For rest of the people this world is fantasy and illusions."
What attracts ghosts and demons?,"Ghost , demons or even God are man invented terms and it stems from the very nature of mind. Mind works on duality when you believe God then you are bound to believe in ghosts. God is positive ghost and ghost is negative God.
Mind is full of questions like this and it has no meanings in real life. You need to be more conscious about monkey questions like this."
What would happen if time moved backward all of a sudden? How would that affect the human beings and celestial bodies?,"There is no such thing as time. Time is man invented measurement to keep track of events or memory. Animals don't use wrist watch.
Time is a concept and only present and eternity exists.Mind is past and future. Mind is time and history.
Concept of month and week is as old as human race and it is actually based on four moon phases.

There is no point in confusing yourself by assuming things that are not."
"How do you cleanse one’s bad karma accumulated over a period of time since childhood? When young, harsh words or actions might be unacceptable to others, and obliviously attracted bad Karma.","Tantra says there is nothing good or bad. Whatsoever your consciousness (not conscience) allows is good and whatsoever creates split in you is bad. All repressions create split in man.
Good or bad karma are invention of very nature of mind. Mind works on duality - happy and sad, day and night, love or hate.
e.g. You tend to hate the person most once you loved the most."
"Why does God only help those who help themselves but not those who really need help? If one can help oneself, then does one really need God's help?","God is biggest lie invented by the man. It is his fascination and search for superiority that he discovered all-power God. That is the reason we all love superhero stories. Faith in God is root of all psychological problems. Because of God man remains crippled and believe in all kind of nonsense of heaven,hell, ghosts and fairies.
Man is exploited in the name of God by politicians and priests.
Removing God psychologically is arduous but once you take quantum leap you will find yourself more responsible and in the utter silence."
Does a clear conscience fear anything?,"Conscience is unnatural. Conscience is residues of conditioning of society, religion and education. It is ego based. It is plastic. Conscience creates split in your personality. For example if you are 50 years old and you see a beautiful 20 years old girl your body will be attracted to her sexually and your conscience will tell you to treat her as daughter. This split makes you confused. Conscience is the basis of all fears in a man.
It is much better to drop conscience and become conscious."
"One of my family member has been possessed with the spirit of aghori sadhu, we asked a lot of people about this but nothing worked, we have been told that someone has done black magic to destroy him … Please help us?","There is nothing wrong with him. There is energy blockage at Swadhisthan chakra ( third chakra) which is causing all mental health problems.
Solution is very simple take him to enlightened Siddha person he will just touch him at third eye (sixth chakra) and within 5 minutes he will be okay."
Does Godi Media really exist?,"All media is biased. Journalism and facts have nothing to do with each other. They don't really care about facts. In fact this all bias stems out of very nature of duality of our mind. But the tragedy of reporting doesn't stop at bias it is stretched to the limits of negativity. News channels have become source of tension and depression. You will not find a single minute of positivity. If you stop watching news channels for one week you will feel much relaxed.
News are merely opinions."
"For a few days I was disturbed because of thinking about the religion, spirituality and God. I took information from internet about those things. Everyone has its own opinion regarding religion and Spirituality due to this I became more tensed?","God is a hypothesis and religion is conditioning of our subconscious mind. Religion is invention of primitive mind. Religion was required for the good of human kind but ultimately religion became tools of politicians and priests to exploit gullible humans.
Religion divides in broader term. Religions have given us 5000 years of wars and destruction. Religions have given us crippled minds. The very basis of religions are flawed. Every religion says there is creator of this world we know as God. In fact there is no God , God is just projection of our father figure we always search for as a child.
All religions have failed to give us peaceful world. There have been maximum killing in the name of religions.
Sooner all the religions expire the better our world will be."
Is god concept is real or it just an illusion created by human brain? Does soul do exist? Do we have to born again and again to get moskha?,"Your question is amazing;-

What kind of food is provided to people living in heaven according to Hinduism?,"Heaven and hell are creation of the priests to control and make money from gullible people.
Whatever one can't have on this earth is projected in heaven. Rivers of somras and apsara who always remains 16 years old. On earth man craves for sex, food and alcohol and same is projected in heaven. If nobody has come back from heaven and hell then how do we know about heaven?
Borrowed truths are more dangerous than ignorance. In ignorance one may come to know the truth someday but borrowed truth are just a closed door or rather a thick wall. There is no chance to know truth if you believe the borrowed truth."
"What caused enlightenment: the destruction of self, being here now, observation of one's feelings without engagement, not trying, pleasure fasting, fearless of wellbeing or something else?","If somebody can tell you the reason of enlightenment then he is selling you enlightenment and it is a scam.
It happens in emptiness. It happens in desirelessness. When one leaves the last desire to be desireless then the divine comes down to Earth and something of sky walks on the earth.
Enlightenment is the synchronicity with the heartbeat of the existence."
When should a leader understand that his followers don't want him anymore?,"This is a beautiful question. But answer is one-liners - Leader understands that his followers don't want him, when he gets defeated after polling."
"I know you’re supposed to just allow everything as it is (thoughts and feelings) and not identity with them, but what do you do when the feelings are so overwhelming that they consume you?","Anything that happens like an accident tends to leave you off-balance. It tends to shake your being away from your centre.
A beautiful story, a very ancient one.
In a province, no rain had fallen for a long time. Everything was dried up. At last the citizens decided to fetch the rainmaker. A deputation was sent to see him in the distant town where he lived with the urgent request to come as soon as possible and make rain for their parched fields.
The rainmaker, a wise old man, promised to do so on condition that he be provided with a solitary little cottage in the open country where he could withdraw by himself for three days. No food or drink would be required, then he would see what could be done. His requests were met.
On the evening of the third day abundant rain fell and, full of.praise, a grateful crowd made a pilgrimage to his house and exclaimed 'How did you do it? Tell us.'
'It was quite simple' the rainmaker answered. 'For three days all I have done is to put myself in order.
For I know that once I am in order, then the world will be in order, and the drought must yield place to the rain.'
If you are in order, then the whole world is in order for you. When you are in harmony, then the whole existence is in harmony for you. When you are in disorder, then the whole world is disorder. And the order has not to be a false one, it has not to be a forced one. When you force some order upon yourself, you simply become split; deep down the disorder continues.
Try to do things you love to do naturally. If you love to cook , then cook. If you love to read , read. Don't try to escape and go on watching news channels. Don't try to escape by going to movie.
Just do something in which you lose the sense of time and place."
How do you keep yourself psychologically fit in this pandemic?,Death is not end.
What will happen if you ever get a chance to dance with your own ghost?,"Ghost , devil or even God are man invented terms and it stems from the very nature of mind. Mind works on duality when you believe God then you are bound to believe in ghosts. God is positive ghost and ghost is negative God.
Mind is full of questions like this and it has no meanings in real life. You need to be more conscious about monkey questions like this."
Is an awakened person aware of every thought that passes through their mind?,"Awakened person becomes witness to his mind permanently. Each and every thought that passes his mind is witnessed by the awareness.
When one becomes awakened then observer is observed as J. Krishnamurti says. Before awakening mind is observer after awakening awareness becomes observer and mind is observed by awareness."
How cosmic or internal energy flow to human body increased. Ìs there any ancient techniques?,You can control cosmic energy if your Kundalini is awakened. Once you become self-realised you will have access to all seven bodies and you can control the cosmic energy through your seven chakras.
Why do humans need such a large variety of foods while other omnivores don't?,"Search for variety of food is synonymous to find variety of girls one desires , variety of poses one tries so the man searches for variety of food. It is a search for meaning ingrained in every man. It is outward search for the meaning and one who turns inward he becomes Enlightened and he never needs variety of food or girls or poses."
Why do we keep chasing after this illusion of everything? Is it a fantasy?,"This world is real but our perceptions are not real. This world is called Maya (illusion) by Hindus. It is illusion because we only see what we want to see. It is fantasy because we are interested in - “ what's in it for me.” That why Hindus call it Rasleela.
This world is stage and we all are players playing many roles in one lifetime.
Only enlightened person can see the world as it is because he has transcended duality of mind. For rest of the people this world is fantasy and illusions."
Is there any astrological indication that someone suddenly gets enlightened and becomes a pure soul?,"I have researched about enlightened people and I found that people who were born in waxing crescent phase of moon became enlightened in his early days and to my surprise they became Enlightened in waxing crescent of moon phase. Enlightenment happens in early morning. Moon is the major cause of enlightenment.
e.g. Osho was born on 11 December 1931 - Moon phase was waxing crescent.
Osho got Enlightened on 21 March 1953 - moon phase was waxing crescent.
You can check this with other Enlightened people. It will be more or less same."
Osho died naturally or he was mudered?,"He was poisoned by President Regan administration. USA used slow poison to kill him. He was kept in 6 jails in 12 days. Like every enlightened being is killed he was also murdered.
But the controversies and conspiracy theory around his murder is also useful to our humanity. How???
Buddha said , “ If you meet Buddha on the street , kill him.”
The path of enlightenment is path of desirelessness. One has to leave all the attachments in this world.
The last attachment of the disciple is the attachment to master. One has to leave that attachment too. So you have to kill Buddha or Osho if you are attached to him. Now all conspiracy theories around Osho death facilitate one to hate Osho and kill him psychologically. Psychology of man works on duality either this or that, one has to swing one end to other end to transcend duality. Transcending duality is the nature of enlightenment.
This clarification might become hurdle in the path of the seekers but I am sure one who is destined to be enlightened, he will be Enlightened regardless of anything I write or I dont write."
Why does Adityanath Yogi always change the name of places which mostly have Mughal names?,It has a dual purpose. One people will be conditioned to religious beliefs. They will be obliged. Second they will be confused and miserable.
Is enlightenment a scam?,"Enlightenment is a scam if someone promises it or it is a hoax till you attain it. It is no-brainer after you attain it.
Without master it is next to impossible. Master can give you pointers. Master can't walk the path on your behalf.
But the one who seeks finds.Sooner or later master appears if he is sought. Those who sit do not find him.
Those who go on the quest are sure to find master. And remember, it is very difficult to come to the right door, doors have to be knocked on.
One has to wander into the wrong market in search of the right. Also this is essential stage of discovery. When you search, you will find that those who were wrong also gave support.Even identifying the wrong as wrong becomes a step to identify the right as the right.
The moment your eyes meet the eyes of right master there will be no delay. There is no need of words just eyes meet eyes and your soul is illuminated. There is no need to force things. It will be joy of freefall.
Meeting of the master is like love at first sight. Like sudden clash of thunders. Like meeting your lost lover.
This is pure love and all love bring you into this world; This love leads you beyond this world. This is the culmination of love. And all the love, eventually brings you down on the body;This love takes you beyond the body. And all love is gross; This love is subtle.
And the day you find master, your all questions start dissolving and utter silence surrounds you. You become one with the master.
You enter the world of silence."
"Why do I have a strange kind of fear of the future, of death and the possibility of taking another birth? Is it normal to have such fears? I want to be completely sure of the future. Is this possible?","All fears have roots in the fear of unknown. Fear of unknown has roots in fear of death. Fear of death is integral part of our survival system. Fight or flight are the basis of our survival. Normally mind is conditioned to be in past or future. Mind remains insecure looking for security but the fact is you are vulnerable to death as long as you are alive, the possibility of death is absolutely certain.
Life is here and now not in good or bad memories, not in future. Start living here and now. Once you start living here and now in present moment, you transcend the fear of unknown, fear of death."
"If something scares you so bad that your nervous system is very easily triggered even years after the event, is this PTSD, or is there a better way of explaining it?","It is not PTSD perhaps. It is Complex-PTSD. It has ingredients of near death experiences. Luckily it can be solved pretty quickly maybe in few days.
One has to understand the process of death then this COMPLEX-PTSD will be gone forever.
Go to emergency ward of hospital and feel the death soon all your fear will evaporate.
Here is solution :-
Live here and now.
Turn your negative emotions into positive emotions like gratitude, forgiveness and compassion.
Share positive things with people you love.
Forego ego , always speak your heart out of compassion.
There are seven subtle bodies of human and each body has ability to cure particular problem. All neurological problems can be solved by working on subtle bodies."
I think I have blocked my spiritual awakening. Is that even possible?,"Which stage are you at ?
It can only be determined by the Enlightened Master who has been through all the stages of spiritual awakening.
Here is complete roadmap to spiritual awakening :-
Six stages to Enlightenment.
There are six layers of the ego (personality) and when we meditate for many years the layers are peeled like peeling an onion.
Here are list of layers :-
Layer one : In this people live artificial life like if they go to funeral they cry with others but their tears mean nothing. They say Hello but to avoid people. Frederick S. Perls called this layer CHICKENSHIT.
Layer two : This layer is pure ego. It is like - I AM PRESIDENT OF AMERICA. I AM HUSBAND OF MISS UNIVERSE. People in this layer are bit better than layer one but dangerous because they become politicians, police officers etc. The Frederick A. Perls called this layer BULLSHIT.
Layer three: When something bad happens in layer two like death of loved one or divorce then people like poets, authors, musicians, lyricists or people good at heart fall to third layer. This layer is called CHAOS. Here people either become alcoholic or druggist or go back to layer two.If one remains meditative and aware then he enters next layer.
Layer four: This is DEATH layer ,where you touch death experiences of yourself and your loved one. If one remains aware in this layer by meditating then he or she enters the LIFE phase. To be frank, in this layer you need a MASTER who can give birth to your new ego otherwise you will move like a zombie or you will revert to layer two.When this layer is being peeled this is Awakening of Heart Chakra. This is also called 'dark night of the soul'. This term was first mentioned in a poem written by the 16th-century Spanish mystic and poet St. John of the Cross. From here you are most likely to descend or transcend. Be careful and remain aware.
Layer five: This layer is called LIFE. Your new ego has to take new form and new dimensions of a loving and compassionate life. You can become Epicurious or Buddha if you remain aware. om here MASTER can't help you. You will be guided by your wisdom.
Layer SIX: This layer is called BLISS. If you come to this layer then you have possibility of becoming BUDDHA- full of pure love and awareness.
Break the shell of every layer before you experience first SATORI and then Enlightenment."
Can tantra get you what is not yours?,Tantra can show you the way to get anything on this earth. Efforts will have to be made by you. Law of karma can't be overruled.
Should an enlightened being earn money by sharing their Truth with followers?,"Enlightened being has to earn money to survive otherwise he will have to live like Kabir, Buddha or Jesus. Which is not gracious in present conditions.
Surprisingly enlightened being becomes misfit to this world if he doesn't share his truth.
Enlightenment has a price to be paid. He will not be able to learn new things and his learning abilities are lost and he can do fewer things than he used to do perfectly before enlightenment.
Human races thrive for brilliant mind and enlightenment takes the mind away. It is good for consciouness but not good for body. Enlightened being has more health issues and less physical strength. His overactive senses become cause of all the mess of body energy system. From sunboy to he becomes moonboy. From intelligent person to he becomes lazy desireless bird, who only does things which are absolutely required.
There is only one way for enlightened being to survive - share his truth to make money to live respectful life."
If realization is so easy then why don't everyone become like Buddha?,"Self-realisation is not easy or hard, it is the way it is. It is like falling in love. It is like you are void. It is like you and your beloved are one.
Self-realisation is like you fall in love. It is like you are Buddha.
I can't tell you what it is, all I can say you will be nobody if you experience it."
"Is neurological disorder related to nervous system problems, and how do you cure it?","If neurological disorder happens to be recent not old then it has something to do with subtle bodies. Man has seven bodies (one physical+6 subtle bodies) each body has corresponding chakra and each chakra has corresponding points in physical body.
Pranic healing can cure this type of neurological problems in few days."
Can the intelligence of the brain be transferred from one person to another through black magic?,"World of black magic has different dimensions. Normal world works on gravity of earth and world of black magic works against gravity of earth it works lower to higher. Normal world is like water which flows higher to lower but world of black magic works like fire lower to higher.
Normally more intelligent person can steal intelligence from lesser intelligent person but black magic can transfer intelligence from intelligent person to lesser intelligent person."
A fifty year old friend of mine is fairly good at solving geometry problems. But for the last few years he has difficulty in handling numbers - he gets confused in handling money during shopping. Is that a sign of brain degeneration?,"There is problem in retrieving information from unconscious mind. There may be many reasons including anxiety, terror or lack of coordination between mind and awareness. In other words he might be having distorted consciouness."
Is stage come where without doing efforts person get in meditation?,"There are two stage one before self-realisation and other is after self-realisation. Self-realisation is a quantum leap, one attains state of no-mind permanently. He starts living in meditation 24X7. He doesn't need to meditate because he always remains in Turiya- the state of meditation."
"Five years back, I used to meditate & experienced many benefits, lost that habit, lot of dramatic things happened meanwhile, Now again I am trying it regularly last few months but, Why I can't experience that same deep thoughtless state like earlier?","Your Inner world and outer world are closely interconnected. You are involved and busy in outer world. Your outer world is sucking your energy like a leech.
If you have unsettled issues regarding money or relations then you will have to either solve the issues or surrender to it.
As long as you cling to things there will be no meditation. You are trying to change outer by changing inner. It works other way around."
What is ego or is ego an illusion?,"Ego is necessary framework of mind to function in this world. But man is something beyond mind - pure consciousness. That is why ego is illusion. But we are identified with ego only all our life.
I am president of America. I am husband of beautiful woman. I am father of two sons etc.
There are six layers of the ego (personality) and when we meditate for many years the layers are peeled like peeling an onion.
Frederick S. Perls has listed six layers of ego in his book :- Ego, Hunger, and Aggression.
Here are list of layers :-
Layer one : In this people live artificial life like if they go to funeral they cry with others but their tears mean nothing. They say Hello but to avoid people. This layer is called CHICKENSHIT.
Layer two : This layer is pure ego. It is like - I AM PRESIDENT OF AMERICA. I AM HUSBAND OF MISS UNIVERSE. People in this layer are bit better than layer one but dangerous because they become politicians, police officers etc.This layer is called BULLSHIT.
Layer three: When something bad happens in layer two like death of loved one or divorce then people like poets, authors, musicians, lyricists or people good at heart fall to third layer. This layer is called CHAOS. Here people either become alcoholic or druggist or go back to layer two.If one remains meditative and aware then he enters next layer.
Layer four: This is DEATH layer ,where you touch death experiences of yourself and your loved one.If one remains aware in this layer by meditating then he or she enters LIFE phase. To be frank, in this layer you need a MASTER who can give birth to your new ego otherwise you will move like zombie or you will revert to layer two.When this layer is being peeled this is Awakening of Heart Chakra. This is also called 'dark night of the soul'. This term was first mentioned in a poem written by the 16th-century Spanish mystic and poet St. John of the Cross. From here you are most likely to descend or transcend. Be careful and remain aware. This space is to help you understand this phase and aftereffects.
Layer five : This layer is called LIFE. Your new ego has to take new form and new dimensions of loving and compassionate life.You can become epicurous or Buddha, if you remain aware.From here MASTER can't help you. You will be guided by your wisdom.
Layer SIX: This layer is called BLISS. If you come to this layer then you have possibility of becoming BUDDHA- full of pure love and awareness.
Break the shell of every layer before you experience first SATORI and then Enlightenment."
Is it true that Guru can show a way but a person has to walk? What is the meaning of “apadipo bhav” said by Buddha?,"Guru can give pointers but disciple has to understand pointers existentially. Like no one can eat or sleep on your behalf , Guru can't walk the talk on your behalf. You have to be open and you should have 100% trust in master.
The truth can't be given it has to be earned and experienced. No scripture can give you truth these are maze.
You are lucky that you have come to this question. Now how you take yourself from here to there is matter of your potential and patience."
Why do people say that there are stages in awareness? I have found it as one constant thing. Are there really states of it that unfold through meditation?,There is only one awareness when it functions through mind it is directed outward and when it functions without mind it is directed everywhere without subject and object. That is ‘is-ness’ of your being.
"Why can anxiety arise from the meditation practice? I’ve had periods where I only get 3 hours of sleep from the stress. But staying on the path and re-finding that observational awareness, eventually heals. But why do these anxiety periods arise?","Whatsoever is repressed including bad memories are stored in unconscious mind.
When meditation starts happening first of all the repressions will surface and you need to observe them and stay aware and observe. Soon all your repressions will fad away one by one and you will attain silence."
"Last night I met with a very strange dream. I saw a person who hung up himself from a tree before he has done it, he just smiles looking at me and hung up. He wore a blue t-shirt black formal pant.What does it mean which I saw? Let me know please 🙏",Probably your beloved is on the verge of leaving or he has lost interest in you. Your subconscious mind has realised that in advance.
Is there any relationship of self-realization and Kundalini awakened?,"Kundalini awakening is by-product of self-realisation or vice-versa.
Buddha and Mahavira never talked about Kundalini because their passage of prana was clear. Chakras are felt if there is blockage in the passage. Blockages might be because of karma or emotions related.
Enlightenment and self-realisation causes Kundalini awakening for sure. That is the reason Osho has talked about Kundalini and tantra extensively."
What is the definition of deja vu?,"Deja Vu is a flashback from prevoius life. The situation seems familiar but you can't recall because this situation has something to do with previous life.
In previous life you must have been in same situation and memory of that is buried in unconscious mind. Your consciouness can relate but your mind can't remember."
What is the best time and method to meditate for spiritual ascension?,"Spiritual ascension ? Just before sunrise, it is 24 minutes and it is called twilight or dawn."
"If Shiva knew that Arjun would win the test given by him before giving him the Brahmastra as God knows the present, past, and future of everyone, why did he conduct the test?","Your 'why' in question is significant because it proves that everything we know is narration by somebody. There must have been something like that happened in past but entry of God in picture is reinforcement of the hypothesis of God.
Today man is more intelligent than the Gods of past.
In fact just remove God from your question then everything will make perfect sense."
Do ghosts really exist?,"There is no ghost. Ghosts are projection of fear of unknown. Man is under fear of death 24X7. In fact God is needed as fatherfigure because of fear of unknown. These concepts stem from dual nature of our mind. Mind works on duality that is the basis of our psychology.
One who believes in God is bound to believe in ghosts. Ghost is shadow of the God. One oscillates between death and divine. Remove God , there will be no ghost. Though it is next to impossible to deny God so you have to find devices to name dark side of God."
What is the direction of Prana when we breathe normally? In which direction does it flow?,"Prana always flows upward and Apana always flows downward.
Apana is responsible for excretion. Sex energy that travel downward becomes sex through Apana and same energy becomes kundalini through Prana.
This is why pranayama is so important in yoga- because it pushes the energy upward and reaches Sahasara and lotus blooms. Same energy through Apana becomes sex and causes birth of the baby."
How do you believe any mantra can save you from a devil or something good will sure to happen? Have you experienced it?,"Mantras are the way to give some work to mind. Empty mind becomes restless. Mantras are the occupation of mind.
There is no devil or God. These concepts stem from dual nature of our mind. Mind works on duality that is the basis of our psychology.
One who believes in God is bound to believe in devil. Devil is shadow of the God. Remove God , there will be no devil. Though it is next to impossible to deny God so you have to find devices to conquer dark side of God i.e. DEVIL."
"As an Indian, if we had a strong hearted desire to be born in any other country after reincarnation for the next human birth, can we be born there?","Boundaries are manmade. Nations are manmade. Existence doesn't know boundaries, that is why sky is one.
If you believe in reincarnation then there is possibility to be reborn somewhere else. But if you have strong hearted desire to be born in any other country it is part of other desires. Nothing is going to change if you keep desiring. Desires are cause of the sufferings.
Let us put it this way :- you can have heaven here and now. Just let go of any desire and start living here and now. Be totally into what you do.
Remember if you can't enjoy this life what will you do in other life ? In other life you will have other desire it is vicious circle of longings no matter what. It is more like dog chasing its tail.
Your being is bliss so let go any desire and enjoy what you have."
Is black magic true? Does it affect people’s behaviour?,"Black magic and tantra are one and same thing only difference is in the application. Black magic is negative side of tantra.
Tantra and black magic is manipulation of cosmic energy.
“The world is an expansion of energy, and life is the crystallization of this energy.What we see as stone is also energy, what we see as life, what we experience as mind/thoughts, what is felt like consciousness, is transformation of energy. The whole cosmos is manifestation of the same energy in infinite forms and ways.”
Anybody who has learnt to tame cosmic energies is capable of using it positively or negatively.
But black magic and tantra is 100% truth.
Immunity from black magic is impossible as tantra and black magic uses same doors and windows to control your mind and consciousness.
Though you can minimise the effects of the black magic by practicing mindfulness and prayer. With meditation and prayers energy becomes dense and clouds of dense energy are nearly impossible to manipulate. To manipulate dense energy one has to apply more psychic force which might not be available to everyone."
What stops a rock from having consciousness?,"Rocks are in the process of evolution like tree are alive but just two stage short of developing consciouness. Animals are one step short of having consciousness.
One day trees will have consciouness and at last rocks will have consciouness. The day rocks will have consciouness the man will have found the new planet to live on.
Stephen Hawking said that man would have to find new planet to live on in next thousand years."
How can social media affect the collective thinking of a new age society?,"Below is the tower of our consciouness :-

Social media affects our thinking with lightening speed and likes and upvotes on various platforms shape the collective consciousness which results in (thinking) trend in our (new age) society.
Modren Medical science talks about herd immunity , herd immunity is exactly because of collective consciousness and only mystics know about it for thousands of years."
Why I am abusing god in my mind for no reason? Whenever I try to pray abusive thoughts comes into my mind on its own. I can't control it. Its happening for 5 months. I am feeling guilty and panicked.,"God has become scapegoat of your frustrations. You have chosen easy target. Try abusing someone on the street , he will set you right. There is no God outside of you so you keep abusing God and one day you will be frustrated of abusing him.
God doesn't give damn to your abuses or prayers because simply God doesn't exist.
Don't feel guilty , take your stand either abuse him or love him. You need God, God doesn't need you. You can't sail in two boats at the same time."
Which meditation did you find more relaxing than Yoga Nidra?,Transcendental Meditation
Are there any mantras to bring rain?,"No mantra can bring rain at least in present times. The stories fascinate us so we believe in miracles. Wheresoever we read might have existed in past but we have no way to prove that. All miracles are afterthought , imagination of minds. There is no salt in it."
"Living a confident (felt blessed) life for about 1 month, today I m again feeling d stress, remembering all negative aspects of my life, inferiority complex, alone, evrything that I thought z over now is haunting me again. Can u help to come out 😥?","The moment you start comparing yourself with others you become tense. Comparison instigates jealousy and this is the common cause of anxiety. Inferiority complex is the outcome of the comparison.
Start to live life of compassion, gratitude and forgiveness. You will find innocence of your childhood again."
"Why do spiritual Gurus & Swamis wear simple clothing, while their seats & backgrounds are often colourful & vibrant? What does that symbolise?","Seats and background you see is the truth of their inner space and simple clothing is truth of disciples.
They make their life colourful by teaching their disciples simplicity. They have to put mask because religion is considered to be serious affair. But inside they know your gullibility and limited knowledge of religion.
This is a business of give and take. You give your money to them they give you hopes. As simple as any business can be."
How can yogis survive without food and water for so many days?,"Purified body of yogi becomes medium for cosmic energy that is why they are able to perform SHAKTIPAT.
There are many people who have not taken food for decades. When cosmic energy passes through their body they become cable of restoring some of the energy out of it. That's how they are capable to live for years without food.
“This universe is an expansion of energy and life is the crystallization of that energy.”"
"How do I resolve anxiety from the root? I have tried psychiatrist, yoga, Ayurveda, hypnosis, and deep breathing but nothing is working out.","Only self-realised person can remove anxiety from root. Because mind is root cause of anxiety and you can be at peace only by transcending mind.
Look at your question , you have tried everything under the sky but still you are at unrest.
First step to fight anxiety is to meditate for at least 25 minutes in the morning. Simple meditation of witnessing of your thoughts will make your thoughts disappear and gradually you will attain silence.
Self-realisation makes you master of your mind and then after you become as silent as ocean after tide."
Did Mark Manson misunderstood OSHO ?https://www.google.co.in/amp/s/markmanson.net/how-to-start-a-cult-and-save-the-world/amp,"Mark Mason is like Steven Hassan, Alexandera Stein and Rick Ross. They think that they perfectly understand the religious cults. All their writings and career is about religious cults.
They can only see through glasses of doubts, because they have been victims of religious cults. They just can't see other aspect of same phenomena.
One is bound to misunderstand Osho if he tries to understand Osho intellectually.
Those who follow Osho blindly also misunderstand him.
Duality is the limitation of mind. It is always like this or that. Followers and critics both are blind.
One who inquires truth of himself can understand him but not before becoming Buddha.
To understand Osho one has to transcend mind and become Buddha."
My boyfriend cheated on me 5 years back. We moved on. But now I'm getting those memories back. Can someone please let me know how to get over it?,It has deeper meaning than memories and your boyfriend. Mind starts distracting when you start to become silent. Say thank you to memories and they will start dispersing.
"Which Key board is best, Roland EX-20 or Casio CTX-700, ॅ for Sound, Quality, and more tones?",In my experience Roland is always better than Casio.
An earworm “cradles” is stuck in my mind. I am trying to forget it forever but can’t. Can meditation help me do this?,"Cradles song is in key of 'A# minor'. Listen to songs in natural key of 'D Major' and 'G Major'.
Whenever earworm comes just say “beautiful song, I like it” and start chanting some mantra like AUM.
This question reminds me of beautiful Tibetan parable -
An old saint knew how to fly and he became very famous. A young man got interested in knowing the secret. He swore that he would devote his whole life to know the secret to flying.He started to live with the old saint.………
After few months, tired of the young man, because twenty-four hours a day he was there…Finally the old man got fed up.He told the young fellow, “Today I am going to tell you the secret.”It is not very difficult. It is very simple.”
He said, “Everything is hidden in the mantra —Om mani padme hum.”
The young man said, “Don't fool me. This is the mantra everbody knows.”
The old saint said, “ I am going to give you the secret the key to open this mantra nobody knows.”
The young man said, “Key? I have never heard that there is a key to open the mantra.”
“The key is, while you are repeating the mantra – just for three minutes – don’t let any monkey pop into your head.”
The young man said, “You seem to be an old idiot! In my whole life I have never thought of a monkey. Why should I think of one?”He rushed down the stairs of the temple where the old saint lived. But strangely, even though he was not chanting the mantra, monkeys started coming. He would close his eyes and they would be there. He would run to this side and they would be there. They were not outside, they were inside his head. As far as he could see, only monkeys and monkeys.
Somehow he tried to sleep but all night monkeys kept crowding his head and the house.
By the morning he was so tired that he rushed to old saint and said, “Please take away your key. I am almost mad!”The old man said, “That’s why I was not telling anybody, because the key is very difficult. Now do you understand why I was silent? Now it is almost impossible to take back the key.”
He said, “I don’t want to listen to a single word from you. You just take this key back and let me go home. And I don’t want these monkeys to follow me!”The man dropped the mantra, he dropped the key. He closed his eyes and there was no monkey. He looked all around and there was no monkey. He tried just once on the way, to see what happens when he says Om mani padme hum and closes his eyes. And they were all coming, from all directions.
“Cradles” has become MONKEY in your mind. Never force any thought to go away; otherwise it will rebound with greater energy. And the energy is yours! You are on a self-defeating track. The more you throw it away the more it will come back.
Whenever the MONKEY comes say “Hello” to him. Be friends and only friend can change friend. One can't change enemy."
Hinduism is said the cause of both separation and extinction of Buddhism from its spot. Why are today Hindu gurus like Osho and Shadguru also misinterpreting Buddha and Buddhism?,"Hinduism was not cause of extinction of Buddhism from India. Buddhism was based on negativa and all upanishads are based on positiva.
People like positive point of view of life. Buddha kept his teachings based on his own experience of enlightenment. For example Buddhism believes in reincarnation but it doesn't believe in soul. This seems contradicting but Buddha maintained this in his teachings regardless of contradiction. Buddha never compromised with his experiences and teachings.
But when Buddhism went outside the India they corrected their mistakes and opted the positive aspects of life and hence Zen was born out of Tao+Buddhism.
Zen is latest wave in America and western countries.
Neither Osho nor Sadhguru misinterprets Buddha it is their understanding and moreover we try to understand out of our limited understanding and that is where the problem is.
It is like butterfly is trying to explain how to fly to caterpillars.
Nothing in this world right or wrong it is our understanding and the dual nature of mind which makes us choose one or other.
Duality is nature of mind and wholeness is nature of awareness."
The more I meditate the more emptier I am becoming. Is meditation bad?,"When meditation starts to happen you start to become witness.
Witnessing is the function of consciouness. As a witness your mind starts to become silent and that is why you feel empty.
No news is bad news.
Imagine you meditate and you fall asleep. This is bad news and every other news is good news.
Congratulations!!!!
Silence is flowering of meditation."
"Why do we take birth, reason?","We live whole life in desires, ambitions and lust. We try to become something keep our search of physical things.
Desires and lust are reason for our birth and rebirth. There is no other reason because life is not a goal , it is a quest to find true-self. It is a mystery to live.
One who attains enlightenment breaks free from the circle of birth and rebirth."
"Are chanting some holy words, observing the breath or thought patterns not really meditation as said by Jiddu Krishna Murthy? If so, what is the real meditation?","First thing first.
What is mind?
Mind is chaos. Mind is chatterbox. Mind doesn't keep quiet even while we sleep. Mind needs occupation. You can see stupidity of mind in guinness book of world record, OMG!Yeh Mera India or if you are more adventurous you can see 'King of Pain'.
Meditation is not chanting mantra.
Chanting mantra is the occupation. Chanting mantra simply causes boredom like lullaby to a child. It is great as tranquilizer. It is not meditation.
Observing the breath or thought patterns not really meditation.
Witnessing the thoughts is the means to reach meditation. When you meditate by witnessing your thoughts then there is a gap between two thoughts, though for few milliseconds and that is where the meditation happens. If you keep meditating then one fine day one of the gap becomes permanent and you enter the state of no-mind permanently - this is also called Samadhi.
So witnessing is the means to reach meditation or witnessing is the meditation."
"Is transcendence of mind possible within oneself, overcoming the darkness of our void and ego within?","Only miracle in human history is man's possibility of transcendence of mind. No creature on earth or in entire universe is capable of attaining it.
Void is our reality. We all are born empty but society, religion and education keep conditioning us. Ego is filled in us by our family and schools.
We start to get identified with our ego. Our ego becomes our mind.
The transcendence of mind is experience of our pure consciousness. First time one comes to know that he is awareness, he is not mind.
Transcendence of mind is called self-realisation and integration into existence is called enlightenment."
What was Nietzsche's explanation of free will in Twilight of idols? Are humans morally responsible for what they do?,"Nietzsche declared - God is dead, now man is free. This revolutionary statement is wrong because there has never been God. God is everything but reality. Man remains crippled in the hands of God.
Nietzsche denies God out of his ignorance and Buddha says it out his realisation.
Either way the fact is there is no God hence we are creatures with free will and we all are fully responsible for our actions."
My father had passed away two years ago when I was 11. I miss him a lot. I have a younger brother. How should I behave towards him? How can I behave responsibly?,"Treat him like a friend. Set him free so that his creative forces are unleashed. Always remember him as a gift from your father.
Never treat him as your property. Always say what is truth,don't bother about his feelings this will prepare him for good and bad also.
Losing dad is great loss but it is also a lesson that we should love everyone around so that when they go we don't regret."
How do you keep your ego in check?,"Ego loves challenge, struggle. Ego wants to win Everest. Ego wants to be king. Ego only knows language of achievement.
To control someone's ego you just have to be indifferent to him. Don't provide him struggle by reducing his involvement in your life. His ego will get frustrated over time and you will win when he will offer you his help voluntarily."
Do enlightened people kill people?,"Absolutely not. After enlightenment the idea of killing just doesn't fit the consciouness of enlightened being.
To understand ‘why?’ we have to understand the difference between self-realisation and enlightenment.
Self-realisation is realisation of true-self. It is only dewdrop which has become aware of itself. There is self and it can revert to ego. The self and ego are very similar , so it happens sometimes that a self-realized man becomes a pious egoist. His egoism might give him reason to commit crime like killing.
Whereas enlightenment is the ultimate truth. The path of self-realization to enlightenment is a quantum leap. Ocean drops into dewdrop.
You are no more, only existence is.
After enlightenment desires, ambitions and relations don't remain attachments so there is no reason for him to kill someone.
That is why most enlightenment persons turn vegiterian."
Why isn't the concept 'power of thought' available in Hindu scriptures?,"Hindus believe in eternal truth of oneself. Mind is cause of illusions. Hindus call this world Maya. India has always maintained that man is pure consciousness aka awareness.
Any power of thinking is illusion of ego/mind. Though you can achieve miracles by thinking in material world but inner world is diametrically opposite. Hindus have valued persons like Buddha , Mahavira, Krishna who conquered themselves.
Science is outer quest hence power of thimking are emphasized in west and they invented material things. Religion is inner quest that is why India has greatest religions of the world."
Why do I see God many times (i.e. idols) in my dream?,When your heart is pure and you are in love then your love turns into devotion. In devotion you start seeing idols of God. Because love is God.
How do I stop dangerous imaginations? I am talking to myself and I am facing acrophobia. Sometimes I have heart attack thoughts.,"Hypertension is caused by overthinking. Anxiety is caused by the fear of unknown. Morning walk and meditation will be helpful.
Meditate by witnessing your thoughts every morning before sunrise. Morning walk will help you to sleep silently."
"If you have anxiety, is your heart rate higher?","Constant fear of unknown causes anxiety and it causes high blood pressure and also increases heart rate.
Morning walk and meditation will be very helpful."
Is there anything like grace?,"Grace is remote cosmic energy transfer to disciple from master. It happens only in deep devotion of disciple (or rather a devotee).
Grace is more like Shaktipat but shaktipat happens on fixed date and time between master and devotee on touch of master on third eye whereas Grace can happen remotely."
Is Mahabharata a work that may open a new and most extensive range for the human mind beyond the present limited and beaten field of its operations?,"Any religious scripture is good for society but it is bound to make human mind lame.
Science is good for material world because it has given all the luxuries of life. But religious scriptures are matter of faith. Faith is always blind. Science can be close to truth but religion is always matter of belief system. We take it as we are told. This leaves little space for mind to grow.
So religion only limits the capabilities of human mind."
What food and exercises strengthen the basic chakra?,"Lower three Chakras are related to our survival in material world. Protein rich food strengthens the lower chakras - root chakra and sacral chakra.
Juices (not citric) strengthen the solar plexus chakra. Protein rich food including fish and eggs strengthens root and sacral chakra.
But to move energy to higher chakras , one needs to alter the diet to sattvic so that light energy can move upward like fire.
Lower chakras symbolise water and higher chakras symbolise fire."
At what age does a child develop his own beliefs and belief systems?,Ego starts to take shape at age of four and belief system starts forming at the age of seven.
Which psychological features force an individual to cling to one's beliefs and belief systems?,"Fear of unknown is the driving force of clinging to belief system.
Though desires are the main cause of the actions. But belief system provides kind of security to mind.
More the miserable one is, more clinging will be there."
Can an enlightened person be sad?,"Never because he knows that he is not mind. Mind is cause of sufferings. The day he becomes swami/master of his mind he burns all the bridges behind unknowingly.
He uses his mind while speaking or writing only. He lives here and now because he doesn't know any other way to live life. He becomes child again. He can't live in past or future.
This is his incapability which we consider as boon. But the fact is he remains happy like trees and birds because he doesn't know how to be sad anymore."
I was meditating with binaural beats. Then I feel something strange. I see a bright light even if my eyes were closed. My heartbeat rate increases. Why did this happen?,"Scenario one :-
Your repressed memories and fears are stored in unconscious mind. When one meditates with binaural beats then it surfaces those repressed memories of pain and tears (like death of loved one) and conscious mind trembles and your heart beat and blood pressure increases.
Scenario two :-
If you hear binural beats for more than 45 minutes then it may take you to your past lives. This is called past life Regression. Because you happened to see bright light this may be the case."
"Does meditation feels smiliar to sleep? Sometimes when I meditate, after some time outside noise and awareness diminishes slowly and all I am aware is just my thoughts. Slowly that also becomes vague and dreamy thoughts. kinda similar to sleep","Congratulations!!
Meditation has started to happen to you. Here is practical map of events one usually experiences with slight changes while meditating:-
Firstly, when meditation starts happening in you, when you are moving inwards in the meditation, suddenly you will feel the great distance arising between you and the sounds or noises around you. You may be sitting in crowdy place , you will notice a gap between you and noises as if you have moved away from that sounds or noises.
You start moving into deep silence and all the noises start receding backwards.
Secondly , You are sitting there where you started meditating but as meditation deepens : you will hear men talking ,birds chirping at a several hundred paces.
It will be like you are going away or world is going away. But everything will be more clear and distinct.
Thirdly, voices of men talking will not seem to be heard directly but as if indirectly, as if they are echoes of the real sounds, not the real sounds themselves.
Sounds and voices will not have substance in them. They will be like white clouds.
Remain open to any experience never try to force things, never try to replicate experience."
How can I meditate if I have a certain question running through my mind?,"Sometimes mind works like a child. When you refrain child from doing something he will be tempted to do that.
In short this is reciprocal hypnotic suggestion. When you try to resist the green light it comes back even stronger than before.
This question reminds me of beautiful Tibetan parable .
An old saint knew how to fly and he became very famous. A young man got interested in knowing the secret. He swore that he would devote his whole life to know the secret to flying.He started to live with the old saint.………
After few months, tired of the young man, because twenty-four hours a day he was there…Finally the old man got fed up.
He told the young fellow, “Today I am going to tell you the secret.”
It is not very difficult. It is very simple.”He said, “Everything is hidden in the mantra —Om mani padme hum.”
The young man said, “Don't fool me. This is the mantra everbody knows.”
The old saint said, “ I am going to give you the secret the key to open this mantra nobody knows.”
The young man said, “Key? I have never heard that there is a key to open the mantra.”
“The key is, while you are repeating the mantra – just for three minutes – don’t let any monkey pop into your head.”
The young man said, “You seem to be an old idiot! In my whole life I have never thought of a monkey. Why should I think of one?”
He rushed down the stairs of the temple where the old saint lived. But strangely, even though he was not chanting the mantra, monkeys started coming. He would close his eyes and they would be there. He would run to this side and they would be there. They were not outside, they were inside his head. As far as he could see, only monkeys and monkeys.
Somehow he tried to sleep but all night monkeys kept crowding his head and the house.
By the morning he was so tired that he rushed to old saint and said, “Please take away your key. I am almost mad!”
The old man said, “That’s why I was not telling anybody, because the key is very difficult. Now do you understand why I was silent? Now it is almost impossible to take back the key.”
He said, “I don’t want to listen to a single word from you. You just take this key back and let me go home. And I don’t want these monkeys to follow me!”
The man dropped the mantra, he dropped the key. He closed his eyes and there was no monkey. He looked all around and there was no monkey. He tried just once on the way, to see what happens when he says Om mani padme hum and closes his eyes. And they were all coming, from all directions.
Never force any thought to go away; otherwise it will rebound with greater energy. And the energy is yours! You are on a self-defeating track. The more you throw it away the more it will come back.
Whenever the MONKEY comes say “Hello” to him. Be friends and only friend can change friend. One can't change enemy."
What is the difference between awareness and concentration?,"Concentration has subject as you and object as other. Concentration is Tango. There is duality.
Awareness doesn't have subject and object. Awareness is beyond duality. Awareness just is like existence of sun or stars."
When will I find my genuine spiritual guru? Will I find in this birth?,"The one who seeks finds.Sooner or later master appears if he is sought. Those who sit do not find him.Those who go on the quest are sure to find master.
Remember, it is very difficult to come to the right door, doors have to be knocked on.One has to wander into the wrong market in search of the right. Also this is essential stage of discovery. When you search, you will find that those who were wrong also gave support.Even identifying the wrong as wrong becomes a step to identify the right as the right.
The moment your eyes meet the eyes of right master there will be no delay. There is no need of words just eyes meet eyes and your soul is illuminated. There is no need to force things. It will be joy of freefall.Meeting of the master is like love at first sight. The sudden clash of thunders. Like meeting your lost lover.This is pure love and all love bring you into this world; This love leads you beyond this world. This is the culmination of love. All the love, eventually brings you down on the body;This love takes you beyond the body. All love is gross; This love is subtle.
The day you find master, your all questions start dissolving and utter silence surrounds you. You become one with the master."
How do I use Kundalini yoga to rise to the second chakra?,"Kundalini yoga is very slow process and sometimes it takes whole life to awaken Svadhishthana Chakra.
Svadhishthana chakra is also called Hara chakra.
Hara is the point where death resides. This is where soul leaves the body from normally.To awaken Hara chakra you will have to conquer the fear of death of yourself and your loved one.
Physical part can be covered by Kundalini yoga but the psychological part has to be addressed seperately to awaken Hara Chakra.
Your meditation has to go deeper to experience the death and ignite the near death experiences many times to become fearless."
"What is the best time to study, pray, and meditate?","Braham Mahurat is best time for study, prayer and meditation. There is two parts of braham mahurat each one of 48 minutes (96 minutes total ) before sunrise.
First part is best for meditation and prayer as atmosphere is calm and clean here you can tap the power of the collective meditation of the people meditating all over the world. You will get energy boost from other meditators.
Second part is good for study where you will have fresh mind after meditation and prayer.
Don't forget to see rising sun and feel the gratitude for making life possible on earth."
"Have you experienced telepathy? If so, when can telepathy happen?","Telepathy happens when one touches his pure consciousness. Telepathy travels through the medium and medium is super consciousness.
Only higher can read lower. Super consciouness can read consciouness or unconsciouness of others from millions of miles."
Can someone do black magic on a victim by getting real name from social media?,"No, he will have to meet the person personally or some medium is required like someone who met him personally."
"If all the animals have the same type of soul, then why do humans have a conscious one?","Animals don't have consciouness. They can't decide they have fixed map of life. They know hunger and reproduction.
Only man has consciouness. He is able to take decisions. The only difference between animals and humans is of consciouness.
Because of consciouness man is capable of attaining enlightenment. No animal can get enlightened."
Is it possible for someone to remember his/her previous birth?,"Certainly there are ways to know past lives but nature has its own way of working. Laws of nature help you forget your past lives. This is how you can live your present life peacefully. Even one life time is such a torture think if you can remember all your past lives what will happen to you. You won't be able to live for one day.
There is little you can do about past. There is something you can for future and there is everything you can do in NOW. Live here and now then your life will become celebration."
What is the spiritual benefits of Hakini Mudra meditation?,"Mudra and meditation has no relation. Mudras are just another device to keep your mind engaged.
Meditation is witnessing your thoughts choicelessly. No matter what mudra you sit in.
Understand the basic of meditation then you can be meditative at anytime , anywhere."
"Why does Sri Sri Ravi Shankar not have supernatural powers or siddhi power like other saints? Why does he not have antargyan, which means reading others’ minds?","Enlightenment and Siddhi has no relation. Self-realisation is self-remembrance.
Enlightenment simply means - “I know myself.”
Siddhis and magiks are tools of showmen.
There is no Siddhis but your ignorance can be exploited. Because you are always ready to be exploited in the name of spirituality and magiks.
Everybody has to follow laws of the nature."
"If you had to choose only one of these two things in your life, which would you choose: meditation or sex?","Sex and meditation are two side of same coin. Sex gives happiness to body and meditation gives happiness to your inner being.
Any tension in mind is eased out by sex. The idea of meditation and enlightenment must have come from the experience of sex. The orgasmic experience of climax in sex can also be achieved by meditation. Meditation is the means to achieve same orgasmic experience of climax without sex.
Everybody has the blissful state of orgasam and when it becomes your permanent nature of your being, you become enlightened.
The state of ecstasy which is achieved by sex can also be achieved by meditation.
Meditation is inner orgasm and sex is outer orgasm."
"What should be done if the 10,000 hour rule leads to severe stress and burnout?","Meditation can ease out the stress. Light exercises or yoga may add few hours to your deep sleep.
Sleep at 10 PM and wake up at 5 AM. Morning walk adds creativity to your mind. Foam roller exercises are also great to ease out any tension in body.
Supplements like multivitamin, vitamin 'C', Vitamin B-complex will also help to stay fit and calm.
To keep your mood good and relaxed minerals like Zinc and Magnisium will be very helpful."
Why am I observing people becoming more egotistic and rude nowadays?,"Fear of unknown is lurking in their unconsciouness. They are afraid, they are insecure whereas you are carefree. You are as you were. They are under pressure.
They cover up their insecurities by being rude and egoistic."
I serve non-vegetarian food through my restaurant. Is it a sin?,"Because this question has crossed your mind. For you it is a sin because you have become conscious of non-veg food.
Your consciousness is getting affected by serving non-veg food. If you don't stop serving then it will become cause of your consciousness discord. Either you don't go to restaurant or stop serving non-veg.
Unfertilized eggs can be served."
Is God a concept or is God a reality? How can we know the truth?,"Neither God is concept nor reality. God is an experience. God is what you can only experience.
Any concept can't define God. Any try to put God in words makes it concept. Don't try to play game of true and false.
God is the feeling of “Ah this!”."
"What does the statement ""once you take the spiritual world seriously, you will start to see a sign in everything, everyone and every situation” mean?","Seriousness is disease. Spirituality means being playful in this very moment.Once you start to live here and now you will find godliness in everything.
Spirituality means living every moment by heart. Only heart opens door to the kingdom of God."
How can I go to the Himalayas to meditate?,"Only cowards go to Himalayas. Facing world and being meditative is most the valued and practical approach to life.
People don't understand the meaning of silence. When Buddha talks about silence , he is talking about the silence that is inside of us and we try to find silence outside like we try to find happiness outside in material world.
People go to Himalayas live there for decades but when they come back into the world they find their selves same ego centric person.
Going to Himalayas won't give you peace. Peace can only be ensured after winning battles of this world.
Just go inside of your being there is Himalayas, stars, rivers and oceans."
"If 'we' are already enlightened, and if no meditation or yoga can cause enlightenment, what is the point of doing any of this? Why am I meditating or doing yoga?","This is the most misunderstood statement because people are lazy they don't even take first step after listening to this statement.
“You are already enlightened” - this sentence is a device to make you feel that enlightenment is just around the corner. This is a device to get you started on the path of enlightenment. Even when it is said very few people start their journey and even fewer reach.
In fact how far one is relative. If the search is very intense then he is very close to enlightenment , just a turn away. If one is still into world of desires and ambitions he is miles away.
The fact is either you are very close or you may be thousand of miles away."

"What does it mean when people say that ""everyone is already enlightened""?","“everybody is already enlightened” - this sentence is a device to make you feel that enlightenment is just around the corner.
It is a device to get you started on the path of enlightenment. Even when it is said very few people start their journey and even fewer reach.

So the fact is either you are very close or you may be millions of miles away."
"Do only Hindus contain seven chakras, but not the Muslims and Christians who call chakras Satanic?","Every human, animal and birds have chakras. Humans have seven. Birds and animals have three.
Due to strong religious conditioning they don't accept the fact. Even priests are against this because if the chakras of every person will open then there will be no religion , one will be religious but there will not be religion as business.
Religions are prisons they make people frog of the pond denying existence of the Ocean. Religions should be for people not that people should be for religion."
Why do I keep imagining green light coming from my forehead for my 3rd eye while meditating? My 3rd eyes chakra is purple light. Why is green light the light that I visualise?,"Sometimes mind works like a child. When you refrain child from doing something he will be tempted to do that.

"Do severely depressed people find it difficult to fall asleep? If yes, why?","Continuous fear of unknown (what will happen?) becomes terror. Terror becomes anxiety. Continuous anxiety becomes depression.
In depression mind overthinks and because there seems to be no solution to the problem one is left with depression and one forgets the problem. Now depression becomes his second nature.
Mind doesn't rest in depression, it starts thinking whenever it detects its absence that is why meditation is not helpful in depression and it is difficult to fall sleep without medicine."

Does the level of ego change at different heights of attitude?,"Level of ego doesn't change in aptitude at different level of attitude. It always works either this or that. But the intensity remains same.
e.g. love can be replaced by hatred but you will hate the person with the same intensity you loved him or her.
There is very popular Aesop's fable :-
Fox and grapes :-
The moral of the Fox and the Grapes is that some people will disparage what they cannot achieve or have for themselves.
Ego is like a fox , grapes are sweet and tasty but if she can't get it , they are sour.
Ego works in duality because language has words for Yes and No only. There is no word for neutrality. Ego has to choose.
Only Edward de Bono has invented word “PO"" for neutrality.
Ego disperses if you can use word “PO”.
Ego also disappears in love. When you love someone ego doesn't remain there that is why we say, “ falling in love.” Ego falls down in love."
"I find it easy to concentrate on crown chakra, last time I saw a light while concentrating. What does that mean? I find difficult to concentrate on lower chakras, why is it so? Please help.","It is very easy to concentrate on Sahasara Chakra. All day and night one is inside his brain.
Lower Chakras are more important as the Kundalini energy resides at the base of spine. Most important chakra is Muladhar chakra ( Root chakra) , once the root chakra is activated then everything flows through to crown chakra.
Regarding light , if you are not feeling vibrations at root chakra then everything is game of mind.
Go slow, water to become vapours needs to be heated till 100 °C, though it looks it evaporated in seconds but to reach 100 °C it takes time."
How does walking in nature change the brain?,"Walking in nature consciously changes brain significantly. If one remains aware as a witness then colours, shapes and sounds of nature help trigger chakras in body.
Every chakra has corresponding colour, shape and sound frequency. When one walks in the nature specially in the morning. The silence of the morning gives a background to the music of the nature and clear atmosphere gives clear vision.
Surprisingly all the enlightened people got enlightened in the nature and in the early morning."
"I cheated on my wife with my brother’s girlfriend, but I love my wife. What should I do?","Going away and coming closer is the way of life. What happened I can see made you love your wife more.
But this shouldn't be your habit. If it happens once it is accident, if it happens twice it is mistake and if it happens thrice it is a habit.
Beware of habit."
What is the difference between consciousness and mind?,"Consciousness is Awareness + mind. Awareness is absolute and mind is not part of it.
In other words awareness is consciouness - mind.
In awareness there is no 'I'. In consciouness there is 'I'."
How do I forgive myself for the failed relationship and heal my heartbreak? She says she moved on but I'm still crying 3 months out and I have obsessive thoughts even though I meditate and exercise daily.,"The basic problem is that you have forgotten your being. Understand that your being is the only bliss in this world. Relations, happiness or even sadness all are here because you are alive.
What will happen if you are not there? If you can't love yourself then you don't deserve love of others. Start loving yourself.
What we know as God actually is mirror reflection of your being. Your being is all that matters. If you are not then there will be nothing in this world or it won't matter to you.
Just remember :-
Nothing (specially no relation) in this world is more important than your being.
YOUR BEING IS THE ONLY BLISS."
Why would someone cry about family/friends every morning in meditation after 4 months of meditating for 40 minutes?,"All the memories, repressions and guilts keep living in unconscious mind. When one starts meditating then your being touches unconscious mind and all that was repressed in unconscious mind start to surface.
If meditation is happening then this is the first sign."
"Meditation has been quite emotional recently. I simply watch and let everything be, everything comes and goes. Been meditating 3 months daily. However, I sometimes feel like crying and frustration after meditating. Why is this?","All the memories, repressions and guilts keep living in unconscious mind. When one starts meditating by witnessing then your being touches unconscious mind and all that was repressed in unconscious starts to surface.
If meditation is happening then this is the first sign."
"Can a spiritual seekers watch movies, listen to music, etc…all these being sense objects?","Spiritual seeker can do anything like any normal person but he has to remain conscious. He should try to be as conscious as possible.
He should be pure of any cleverness, cunningness and phoney.
e.g. If he is making love then sex should come out of love. One should not pretend to love to have sex."
"What would happen if someone speaks ""OM"" for 1 million times?","Nothing will happen by speaking 'OM'.
OM is not right word to chant. Right word is AUM. Universe is a reverbrations of energy. AUM means Absolute Universal Mind- Cosmic Consciousness.
There are three states of our being - waking, dreaming and sleeping.
When you chant the three syllables of A-U-M, you will experience vibration in your body at three spots named below.
When you chant AA: You will experience the vibration around your navel and abdominal area. It is related to the waking state.
When you chant UU: You will experience the vibration in and around your chest cavity. It is related to the dream state.
When you chant EEMM: You will experience the vibration in and around your throat. It is related to the state of deep sleep.
The fourth state is Turiya. Turiya has something of waking and something of sleeping. Sleeping not in the way you know. Sleeping means state of no-mind.
After you chant one Aum, there’s a pause. This gap represents Turiya, or infinite (cosmic) consciousness.
Chanting AUM takes you to state of no-mind - the utter silence.
State of no-mind is also called Samadhi. Once one attains permanent state of no-mind , he/she becomes enlightened."
What is that 'natural' state every spiritual master and the enlightened ones talk about?,"We have three state of mind - waking, dreaming and sleeping. Fourth is not state it is our nature called Turiya. Turiya has something of waking and something of sleeping. Sleeping not in the way we know. Sleeping means state of no-mind.
Once one attains the state of no-mind permanently- pure consciousness, one starts living in Turiya - the fourth - the permanent state of meditation - Turiya is where meditation happens regardless of waking or sleeping and there is no dreaming or unconsciousness.
On enlightenment Turiya becomes our natural state of being."
"What is your review on Dhyana, the world's first meditation tracker to help you master mindfulness gadget available on the Amazon? Isn't it amazing?","Why meditation tracker ? Why don't you launch Enlightenment Basher?
Direct to the destination.
And 'MOKSHA' is more convincing , you will make lot of money."
When meditating I am struggling with awareness. I feel clouded with this idea that I should be aware of everything at once. And am failing otherwise. I try watch these events. How do you approach these situations? Thanks!,"This question reminds me of beautiful Tibetan parable .
An old saint knew how to fly and he became very famous. A young man got interested in knowing the secret. He swore that he would devote his whole life to know the secret to flying.
He started to live with the old saint.………After few months, tired of the young man, because twenty-four hours a day he was there…Finally the old man got fed up.
He told the young fellow, “Today I am going to tell you the secret. It is not very difficult. It is very simple.”
He said, “Everything is hidden in the mantra —Om mani padme hum.”
The young man said, “ Don't fool me. This is the mantra everbody knows.”
The old saint said, “ I am going to give you the secret key to open this mantra nobody knows.”
The young man said, “Key? I have never heard that there is a key to open the mantra.”
“The key is, while you are repeating the mantra – just for three minutes – don’t let any monkey pop into your head.”
The young man said, “You seem to be an old idiot! In my whole life I have never thought of a monkey. Why should I think of one?”
He rushed down the stairs of the temple where the old saint lived. But strangely, even though he was not chanting the mantra, monkeys started coming. He would close his eyes and they would be there. He would run to this side and they would be there. They were not outside, they were inside his head. As far as he could see, only monkeys and monkeys.
Somehow he tried to sleep but all night monkeys kept crowding his head and the house.
By the morning he was so tired that he rushed to old saint and said, “Please take away your key. I am almost mad!”The old man said, “That’s why I was not telling anybody, because the key is very difficult. Now do you understand why I was silent? Now it is almost impossible to take back the key.”
He said, “I don’t want to listen to a single word from you. You just take this key back and let me go home. And I don’t want these monkeys to follow me!”
The man dropped the mantra, he dropped the key. He closed his eyes and there was no monkey. He looked all around and there was no monkey. He tried just once on the way, to see what happens when he says Om mani padme hum and closes his eyes. And they were all coming, from all directions.
“I should be aware of everything at once. And am failing otherwise.” has become MONKEY in your mind.
Never force any thought to go away; otherwise it will rebound with greater energy. And the energy is yours! You are on a self-defeating track. The more you throw it away the more it will come back.
Whenever the MONKEY comes say “Hello” to him. Be friends and only friend can change friend. One can't change enemy."
"Who was Shiv's guru.You specified that Ram, Krishn all attained already a state of mind from previous births that they were all able to practice themseleves.So they all should have had a guru but how Shiv became a aghor when he was the first aghor?","When Aryans came to Bharat, they started replacing culture and existing Gods with their own Gods. Existence of Lord Shiva was so powerful that Aryans had to accept him as God.
Lord Shiva is the first alien who landed on planet earth. After his living for thousands of years this earth flourished. Lord Shiva is known as God of destruction but he is also creator of the universe. We could only see the death part and we ignore his contribution as creator of this earth. Even today there is no God equilent to Shiva. Shiva explored heights and depths of human potential.
Where Lord Krishna is multifaceted , Lord Shiva is symbol of Power. Shiva had no Guru because existence of humans on this earth started with Lord Shiva. Traditions of Aghori are from other planet it is not of planet earth."
How can one meditate for 41 days continuously just like Shiva?,"Ultimate alchemy that happens on Moksha has seeds in meditation.
We have three states of mind - waking, dreaming and sleeping. Fourth is not state it is our nature called Turiya. Turiya has something of waking and something of sleeping. Sleeping not in the way we know. Sleeping means state of no-mind.What we know as witnessing in meditation is seed of Turiya.
Moksha is flowering of the meditation.
Once one attains the state of no-mind permanently- one step more one attains Samadhi - pure consciousness, one starts living in Turiya - the fourth - the permanent state of meditation - Turiya is where meditation happens regardless of waking or sleeping and there is no dreaming.
Days are just indicative , Lord Shiva is meditation.

What is the psychology behind chakras (as someone who does not believe in souls and spirit)?,"Chakras are energy centres in body having corresponding points in brain. Every living being has chakras including animals.
Animals and birds have only three Chakras and humans have seven chakras.
Because only humans have consciousness they are able to feel and control energy in chakras and they can experience divine as a result of consciouness."
"What is the ultimate aim of practicing meditation and why? I know there are rewards of meditation like peace of mind, feeling joyous, reduction of stress etc but are these the ultimate aim of meditation?","The ultimate alchemy that happens on enlightenment has seeds in meditation.
We have three states of mind - waking, dreaming and sleeping. Fourth is not state it is our nature called Turiya. Turiya has something of waking and something of sleeping. Sleeping not in the way we know. Sleeping means state of no-mind.
What we know as witnessing in meditation is seed of Turiya. Once you attain the state of no-mind permanently- pure consciousness, you start living in Turiya - the fourth - permanent state of bliss. Bliss - where all your questions become answers.
Meditation is a means to attain ENLIGHTENMENT."
"During meditation What is the meaning of a white bright light and divide in two equal light balls, I identified as one is God and another one is me, later my light ball dissolved completely in God white ball, there is no sign of me left?","This is not meditation. Your mind is at unrest. There is severe emotional turmoil in your life. You are full of fear and insecurities. It is some story your mind is weaving according to the state of mind.
Meditation is about witnessing thoughts not weaving thoughts. To stay calm down your mind , do some physical exercise for 30-45 minutes and then take bath and sit for meditation."
"There have been several reports of Sushant Singh experiencing paranormal phenomena. Has anybody looked more into it, or was it all made up to derail any investigation to show he was delusional?","Sushant was gem of heart and you can see what is happening around his death. Nobody is worried about his death.
Only mad can live in this madhouse. People around him was not worth of having such a beautiful soul so he left these cats now there is only catfight.
One who accepts death smilingly doesn't remain wandering in this world , he must have taken new birth somewhere.
All the stories you hear are after thoughts of people with different motives and bizarre mind drills.
Let this topic become dated , you will be surprised if you will look behind that how much of our time media wastes and how those cats (anchors) enjoy swinging cradle."
Our house does not have a silent atmosphere for doing meditation. What's your suggestion for me to exercise meditation?,"If you understand that meditation is not doing then you can be meditative at anytime, anywhere.
Witnessing is the only meditation you will ever need all your life.
There are three ways you can practice witnessing. You can choose any one out of three or you can practice all three :-
By witnessing your activities(walking,talking,eating, breathing) and be aware of natural needs of the BODY like hunger, thirst,lust (specially). Vipassana is one of this type of meditation.
By witnessing your emotions, always be aware of your emotions like anger,hatred,fear, jealousy and choose positive emotions like gratitude, compassion, forgiveness.Transform your poisons into nectar.
By witnessing your thoughts - you can meditate by witnessing your thoughts. There are gaps between thoughts. That is where meditation happens. If you meditate for years then one fine day one of the gap will become permanent and you will enter state of no-mind - utter silence."
What will happen if all Indian Sikhs cut their hairs and merge back to Hinduism as RSS types organization wants? Will Hindus dance like hell or get sad?,"What is the difference between Sikhs and Hindus? These two are religions and religions are prisons. Leaving one prison and getting into other won't make any difference.
Religion is personal , everybody has his own religion inside of him everything else we see outside is decoration of belief system.
Religion is framework to organise humans in society, culture and creeds.
I don't know about anybody but one who will convert , it is going to be case of lost identity . He will have hard time finding himself."
"For the past 1 month, I can't take deep breath. I can’t yawn properly. I'm tensed. What are some suggestions?","I am not qualified doctor. I am going to give perspective I know from my experience.
There is coordination problem between your awareness and second body called pranamay kosh.
Solution:-
First step :
Tap your body with your crossed hands and feel your body. 3 min.
Second step :
Put your right hand behind your heart and left on left side like hugging. Feel your body specially heartbeats. 4 min
Third step :
Put your right hand on forehead and left on your heart and feel the breathing going up and down. 4 min.
Basic idea is to let your awareness start coordinating with your body.
It will take only four days to recover."
"Why is so-called black magic more powerful, and why can't one get cured of it completely?","Black magic and tantra are one and same thing only difference is in the application. Black magic is negative side of tantra.
Tantra and black magic is manipulation of cosmic energy.
“The world is an expansion of energy, and life is the crystallization of this energy.What we see as stone is also energy, what we see as life, what we experience as mind/thoughts, what is felt like consciousness, is transformation of energy. The whole cosmos is manifestation of the same energy in infinite forms and ways.”
Anybody who has learnt to tame cosmic energies is capable of using it positively or negatively.
Immunity from black magic is impossible as tantra and black magic uses same doors and windows to control your mind and consciousness.
Though you can minimise the effects of the black magic by practicing mindfulness and prayer. With meditation and prayers energy becomes dense and clouds of dense energy are nearly impossible to manipulate. To manipulate dense energy one has to apply more psychic force which might not be available to everyone."
Is your mind a barrier to achieve enlightenment?,"Mind is the only barrier to attain enlightenment. In fact enlightenment is transcendence of mind only.
Mind is operating system much like windows and Android or MacOS.
Let's put it this way :
Your brain is hardware like new computer and mind is operating system like windows 10.
Enlightenment is low-level formatting of brain and reinstalling new operating system 'Linux'.
How to format brain and reinstall OS?
You will have to use commands of mind at low-level to format brain.
Now new OS will be new pathways which will be new mind - more compassionate and loving.
That is why path of enlightenment is arduous.
Path of enlightenment is death of mind/ego and resurrection."
What do monkeys do at night when they have trouble falling asleep?,"Monkeys never have trouble sleeping because they exhaust their body by being active all day. They don't sit silently for a moment.
On the other hand man's mind remains monkey all day all night and they don't exhaust their body rather they develop habit of using mind as monkey.
Man's mind is monkey.
Monkey's body is man's mind."
"Does awareness lead to analysis?If yes ,how?","You are confused between awareness and consciouness.
Consciouness is 'awareness with mind'.
Awareness is 'consciousness without mind'.
Absolutely 'NO'. Analysis is thinking and thinking requires memory. Awareness doesn't have memory. Awareness is here and now no past , no future.
Analysis is job of mind. Consciouness includes mind so consciouness can only analyse present moment. But awareness can't analyse or take decisions/actions. These are duties of mind."
I noticed something very unusual yesterday. Yesterday after afternoon each and every incident that occurred with me seemed to be happened with me earlier too. I knew that what was about to happen. It seemed the past is repeating. Why so?,"This is a flashback from prevoius life also called Deja Vu. The situation seems familiar but you can't recall because this situation has something to do with previous life.
In previous life you must have been in same situation and memory of that is buried in unconscious mind. Your consciouness can relate but your mind can't remember."
"Urge to yawn to catch my breath or exhale fully? Taking anti anxiety and depression medications already but nothing helped. Blood tests are normal and chest x-ray, ecg as well…what could be the possible cause?","There is coordination problem between your awareness and second body called pranamay kosh.
Solution:-
First step :
Tap your body with your crossed hands and feel your body. 3 min.
Second step :
Put your right hand behind your heart and left on left side like hugging. Feel your body specially heartbeats. 4 min

I am very arrogant and egoistic in nature. What should I do to remove my arrogance and ego?,"Only perfect ego can surrender. You can give what you have. Higher the threshold deeper will be the surrender.
There is nothing to be done.The day you will come accross something deeper than your ego, e.g. the day you will fall in love , your ego will subside and you will enjoy the freefall."
"Is having a drink after a mindfulness meditation session better than having a drink without the meditation, especially when you're stressed out and you want to take the edge off?","Good news !!
You can meditate while having drinks. Just try to be as mindful as you can while having drinks this will train you to be more conscious as you drink more and more.
Neem Karoli Baba used to test his consciouness with psychedelics. Ram Dass also did similar experiments with psychedelics."
Does Bhakti start after you are liberated from the material world? Or can it start even while living in this material world in a material body? What is the exact relationship with Moksha and Bhakti?,"Bhakti is divine love affair between God and devotee.
Bhakti means subject dissolves into object. Only 'you' remains , ‘I' disappears.
When subject disappears then this material world disappears automatically.
First subject dissolves into object and then object also disappears.
There is a beautiful story of love affair between Meera and Krishna.
Meera fell in love with Krishna at the age of 4-5 when she saw statue of the Krishna.
When she was 33-34 years old she started singing and dancing songs of Krishna in the streets.
Because this was a disgrace to her royal family, she had to leave the hometown.
She started to live in other town away from hometown.
After long time her brother came to take her back and insisted if she won't agree to go along with him , he would die there and then.
The Meera said, "" If I have to go then I shall have to ask RanchoordasJi/ Krishna.""
She went inside and never came out again. She disappeared into Krishna Statue. Krishna took her into his divine cuddle.
Disappearance of the Bhakt is called Bhakti and disappearance of both is called Moksha."
What is meant by turiya (pure divine consciousness) and how does it differ from contemplative meditation? Are they same?,"Four states of consciousness are waking, dreaming, sleeping and the fourth is Turiya. Turiya means the fourth.
Waking is consciousness + thinking. Dreaming is consciousness + thinking. Sleep is consciousness minus thinking. Turiya is consciousness minus thinking.
Turiya is also called samadhi.
Samadhi has something similar to sleeping and something similar to waking also. Samadhi is ‘waking sleep'. Sleeping not in the sense we know but sleeping means there is nothing to think about - the state of no-mind.
Turiya/samadhi is hybrid of waking and sleeping.
Waking
Dreaming
Sleeping
Samadhi/ Turiya
Turiya is not state of consciousness. Turiya is Awareness. Turiya is nature of our being we are not aware of.
Contemplative meditation is act of mind and Turiya is state of no-mind. They belong to different realms of our being."
Why do we always remember one's mistakes or pinpoint one's mistake and not appreciate the good deeds every time?,"Inferior people keep track of mistakes of other so that they can hide their own mistakes.
Generous people remember good deeds of others and improve relations with others based on good deeds.
It is simply matter of upbringing of the person."
Does the true being manifests itself as the situations spontaneously or is it pre planned (out of my experiential understanding I know that every objective experience everything that exist is awareness/ true being)?,"By and large awareness manifests spontaneously in near death experiences.
Pure consciousness aka awareness manifests your true-self.
Before understanding this answer one needs to understand the difference between awareness and witnessing.
Witnessing is an act : there is a doer-witnessing has the subject and object , there is duality - one who is witnessing and one who is being witnessed.
Awareness is absolutely devoid of subjectivity and objectivity. There is no duality. The subject and object are dissolved.
That is why awareness is spontaneous but It happens in dire straits and witnessing is deliberate doing.
The door to awareness is witnessing."
Is it true that newborn babies think and see their past lives?,"For the time between death and rebirth consciousness is in sleep deeper than our deep sleep.
It is very nature of the existence that one doesn't remember his previous life. Had it happened it wouldn't have been impossible for one to live life.
At present everybody is very much puzzled in this life , if he remembers past lives then this earth will be madhouse.
Human kids are most helpless as compared to animals. Kids remain unconscious for first 5–6 months then they start to know their surroundings and thenafter they develop the sense of self. They don't have mind to think or remember. Mind starts forming with the sense of self/ego."
Is there any connection between hormones and meditation?,"There isn't direct relation between meditation and hormones or testosterones of human growth hormones (HGH).
But meditation+food do have relation with hormones specifically testosterones and HGH.
If one is having non-vegetarian food and meditating he is going to have frequent surge in sexual energy. Because non-veg food empower lower three chakras of body including the root chakra which is connected to reproduction.
If one is having sattvic food his upper three chakras will get the pranic energy and he will be more towards spirituality or God.
In middle we have balancing chakra called heart chakra this is first spiritual chakra. When energy moves into heart chakra person becomes balanced in every walk of life."
"Once You start accepting reality and drop mind stories, will the reality offer more challenges compare to earlier like video game stages? Which ultimately offer same suffering in case non identifying with mind situations?","If you accept the reality then reality is going to offer more challenges but not exactly like video game stages.
If you accept reality you remain part of it but at the other end. Neither accepting nor challenging is going to help because this is again a duality.
To transcend mind one has to become witness.
When you start witnessing the reality then the mind will drop the stories (you will live here and now) hence the reality will dissolve into your being.
Mind knows two states in NOW, either duality or witnessing anything beyond is 'pure consciousness' aka awareness."
"Why do some spiritual leaders talk extremely slow? For example, Osho in the YouTube video ""OSHO: Risk Everything for Awareness"" takes a 6 second break. ","Enlightenment doesn't come without price. Price is consciousness of the enlightened being doesn't remain centred in mind. Consciousness is stretched all over his body. There is a time lag between his awareness and consciousness.
Enlightened being uses his mind only while talking or writing , rest of the time he doesn't use his mind he remains centred in ‘pure consciousness' aka awareness.
Because of the time lag between his awareness and consciousness enlightened being speaks slowly.
This is where anatomy of enlightened being differs from others.
PS :Awareness means ‘consciousness without mind' or ‘pure consciousness'."
How do you activate Sri Chakra?,"Sri chakra or Sri Yantra meditation/ pooja works with the predominal energy which exists from pre-creation also called cosmic energy. Cosmic energy exists in all forms of manifestation, in fact all forms in universe is manifestations of same energy.
But in your case it is your own energy that will be getting aligned and you will recover or get better.
All the power exists inside of us but we need some device ( like Sri Yantra) to uncover it.
You are more powerful than anything on this earth."
How can I differentiate between visions and illusions created by the mind while meditating?,"Anything you vision is illusion. Everything you feel is real. Imaginations are product of desires and differentiating or categorising is doing.
Meditation is witnessing without choice - a choiceless choice. Don't choose this against that. Don't choose good against bad.
Be like a kid sitting by the water waiting to clear the muddled water to find his lost toy in the water.
Sensory clues are more subtle than visual clues."
"What is so great about meditation, that I should start doing it?","There is nothing greater than your being. Everything is for you , you are not for anything. Everything here even God exists because you are alive.
Sleep is there because you are alive. Walking,talking ,swimming and thousands of things are there to serve you. Know yourself.
Once you will be gone then nothing will remain for you. Your being is the greatest gift to this universe."
"During meditation, how does one know if they are experiencing pure consciousness or just silence and stillness?","Here is some practical clues I know from my experience of meditation :-
Firstly, when meditation starts happening in you, when you are moving inwards in the meditation, suddenly you will feel the great distance arising between you and the sounds or noises around you. You may be sitting in crowdy place , you will notice a gap between you and noises as if you have moved away from that sounds or noises.You start moving into deep silence and all the noises start receding backwards.
Secondly , You are sitting there where you started meditating but as meditation deepens : you will hear men talking ,birds chirping at a several hundred paces. It will be like you are going away or world is going away. But everything will be more clear and distinct. Your breathing will become slower.
Thirdly, voices of men talking will not seem to be heard directly but as if indirectly, as if they are echoes of the real sounds, not the real sounds themselves.Sounds and voices will not have substance in them. They will be like white clouds. You will feel your body disappearing like a smoke and only your breathing will remain there. This is the point of pure consciousness aka awareness.
Sequence of experiences may vary slightly but by and large it will remain same when the meditation will deepen."
Why was Osho attacking Jains for their obssession with money and doing business? Is it wrong?,"He used to speak against getting identified with money. He used to say there is a materialistic person like Jains in everybody.
While condemning Jains he refers to materialistic person hidden inside of everybody and that hidden person behaves more or less like people behave in real world.
There is nothing personal about it."
Many highly influential people turn on spiritually at some point in life. What do you think are the reasons?,"When one searches meaning outside he becomes president of America or he becomes richest man in the forbes list like Jeff Bezos. Some people keep searching meaning outside and die.
But someday some turns inward and become spiritual mostly this happens when something bad happens like break-up or death of loved one. Something in them dies also with the end of relation or death of loved one. This is the case with sensitive people. They can't imagine life without other person. Either they commit suicide or they turn inward- the journey of heart starts.
This journey leads one to finding his true-self also called Nirvana."
Can we conclude that each and every place on the Earth is haunted some way or the other?,"Each and every place is haunted because ghosts are creation of your mind and you are always identified with your mind.
It is like either God is everywhere or God is nowhere.
Either ghosts are everywhere or nowhere."
Does evening meditation help in getting deep sleep?,"One deserves deep sleep if he works hard for at least 8 hours per day otherwise he will suffer insomnia.
Meditation helps to silence the mind but if your body is at unrest because of over-rest then meditation will not help.
You have to earn deep sleep. For deep sleep wake up before sunrise and go to bed at 10 PM. Brisk morning walk will also help. Avoid watching news channels and reading newspapers at night."
Why is extremism in Islam dangerous for the world?,"Extremism is result of inflated ego. Extremism has very little to do with religion. You will find extremists in every religion. They live and die unconsciously. There is nothing to worry about them because they are here for millennia.
Small wars here and there rest life goes on.
They are not threat because if the war will happen then this whole world will be destroyed ,so what , we all shall die then why should we bother?
If the world will be destroyed then everybody will die and there is little point living alone on this earth."
I got into a fight with my grandmother and said cruel things to her. What do I do now?,"Go and say “sorry” and remember you are here in this beautiful world because of your parents and ancestors.
Be thankful to your grandmother and if you start loving your parents you will love yourself also."
Does the being/awareness manifest spontaneously and gives us/governs situations aka suffering conducive to our realisation of our true being?,"Yes, awareness governs the situations/sufferings conducive to our realisation of true-self.
By and large awareness manifests spontaneously in near death experiences (NDE) .
Before understanding this answer one needs to understand the difference between awareness and consciousness.
Consciouness is mind + awareness: there is a doer-consciouness has the subject and object , there is duality.
Awareness is ‘consciouness without mind' or pure consciousness. Awareness is absolutely devoid of subjectivity and objectivity. There is no duality. The subject and object are dissolved.
That is why awareness is spontaneous but It happens in dire straits.
Additional information :-
This world is mainly a play of duality. One is witnessing and other is being witnessed. Whenever awareness arises the witness and the one who is being witnessed dissolve into one. They become one."
What is consciousness levels of mind?,"Mind has three major sections - 1) Conscious 2) Subconscious and 3) Unconscious.
Conscious mind and subconscious mind play main part in our everyday life.
When you read newspaper or writing , you are using Conscious mind. There is conscious efforts.
You use subconscious mind in day to day activities like brushing you teeth, wearing clothes etc. Subconscious mind work automatically without any conscious effort.
Unconscious mind is where Conscious and subconscious mind store memories, methods and procedures. Unconscious mind is storage device like Hard disk or memory card."
"Is it okay that my breath goes very slow while meditating? Today, I suddenly realized that I was just breathing for 1 second but holding it for a long time.","Body, breathing and thoughts are very deeply interlinked.
When your body relaxes then breathing becomes slower and thereafter your thoughts will start dissolving. This is when meditation will start happening spontaneously.
This is good sign , congratulations!!"
"How clear can one see/experience while meditating? I don't see anything other than lights, but I want to know how clear pictures/experiences can get while meditate.","Here is some indicators I know from my experience of meditation :-
Firstly, when meditation starts happening in you, when you are moving inwards in the meditation, suddenly you will feel the great distance arising between you and the sounds or noises around you. You may be sitting in crowdy place , you will notice a gap between you and noises as if you have moved away from that sounds or noises.
You start moving into deep silence and all the noises start receding backwards.
Secondly , You are sitting there where you started meditating but as meditation deepens : you will hear men talking ,birds chirping at a several hundred paces.
It will be like you are going away or world is going away. But everything will be more clear and distinct.
Thirdly, voices of men talking will not seem to be heard directly but as if indirectly, as if they are echoes of the real sounds, not the real sounds themselves.
Sounds and voices will not have substance in them. They will be like white clouds.
Visual indicators don't work in initial stages of the meditation but when you go deeper into meditation you can actually see blue/white/purple light and you can also feel your body levitating."
What is the difference between Moksha and Satori?,"Satori is glimpses of Samadhi / moksha. Moksha is permanent cessation of mind as master. Moksha is permanent state of pure consciousness.
You can say before moksha one experiences Satori many times to prepare the body for greatest happening of life. It is order of the nature - first Satori then Samadhi /Moksha."
"What's the difference between cosmic mind, cosmic energy, and cosmic consciousness?","This universe is an expansion of energy and life is the crystallization of the same energy. What we see as matter, what we experience as thoughts and consciousness - all are a manifestation of the same energy infinite forms.

The conscious mind is active and we use the conscious and subconscious mind in day to day activities, below it we have an unconscious mind where our conscious mind store memories, knowledge as memory blocks and retrieves it on demand of conscious/subconscious mind.
Still one level down we have a collective unconscious mind which is part of our society/political ideology and religion.
One more level down we have a cosmic unconscious mind which includes all of the earth- animals, rocks, mountains. It is a universal mind or cosmic mind - an order of disorder before this creation or re-creation.
Once one attains samadhi, he dips down to the cosmic mind.
One who attains samadhi goes deeper and simultaneously the keys to higher and higher opens till cosmic consciousness.
You need to go deeper into roots to grow to highest by meditating.
It happens like this your awareness goes deeper to roots and your consciousness starts climbing the ladder upwards to the cosmic consciousness.
Much like cosmic consciousness, there is a cosmic heart of existence.."
How do I make a very egoistic person accept his mistakes?,"First thing first.
What feeds ego?
Food of ego is struggle, race, challenge, competition. Ego doesn't care about wrong or right all it cares how can ‘I’ win?
This mind's 'I' enjoys arguments, illogical logics and if you try to win then you are going to feed other's ego by satisfying your ego. If you try to win then your ego is also asking for challenge. Isn't it also ego feeding?
But once you avoid any argument ego will subside. Ego will become helpless and it will feel defeated.
Magic words are 'be indifferent to provocations'.
Just chill….."

Is spiritual enlightenment permanent?,"Enlightenment is point of no-return. Neither it is compulsory to enter into state of Samadhi nor it is optional to return from Samadhi.
It is not summer vacation. Once you are in it , you are in it otherwise everything is illusion of mind.
There is permanent rewiring of the brain and one can't undo it.
There are three state of our being - waking, dreaming and sleeping. Enlightenment is our nature of being in fourth - Turiya - the state of no-mind. Turiya has something of waking and something of sleeping. Sleeping not in the sense we know. Sleeping means state of no-mind."
"Is ""spiritual enlightenment"" a belief?","God is a belief , a hypothesis. Soul is a concept. Reincarnation is unexplainable or phoney.
But enlightenment is as true as death."
"When I sat for meditation, after five minutes, I always remove my clothes. It automatically happens with me. How?","This happens due to impure pranic energy and emotional imbalance.
In other words there is problem in your diet that is causing imbalance in your root chakra (muladhar chakra).
Solution : That can be corrected by changing food habits to vegitarian for few weeks.
There is emotional clinging to someone or something who is not available at present. This causes turmoil in your emotions and the pranic energy starts flowing downwards to Solar Plexus chakra swiftly hence this situation arises.
Solution : Practice forgiveness, gratitude and surrender to circumstances.
PS : I assume you are wearing loose clothes and using AC or weather is around 27 °C almost."
Can people of any age group chant Mahamrityunjaya Mantra?,"Mantra has no power. All the power is within you. Mantras are just device to create boredom like a mother's lullaby. Mother keeps repeating few words and child goes to sleep.
Anybody can chant any mantra there is no harm.
But for kids I guess ‘Coca Cola’ will be better mantra.
Coca cola coca cola coca cola."
"Some people say that meditation can't be done but it happens, so how do we let it happen? We must do something, and in consequence meditation will happen, but what should we do if we can't do meditation?","Meditation happens when consciousness is pure of mind/thoughts/contents.
Remaining choiceless is key to meditation. Not choosing this against that, like not choosing good thoughts against bad thoughts.
Witnessing your thoughts coming and going remaining choiceless as J. Krishnamurti says - choiceless choice.
Now this is contradiction - it seems contradiction but it is not.
For example if you are going on the road and you see two girls fighting fist to fist. You will watch them but you won't favour one for other. Now you know there is fight but you don't choose side now this is choiceless choice. It is like watching the river flowing.
When you meditate by witnessing your thoughts then there is gaps between thoughts for few milliseconds and that is where meditation happens. This is state of no-mind , though for few milliseconds. If you keep meditating for years then one fine day one of the gap will become permanent and you will enter Samadhi - the state of no-mind."
Which type of meditation do I need to do if I am not able to devote more time for the same?,"Witnessing is the only meditation you will ever need all your life.
There are three ways you can practice witnessing. You can choose any one out of three or you can practice all three :-
By witnessing your activities(walking,talking,eating, breathing) and be aware of natural needs of the BODY like hunger, thirst,lust (specially). Vipassana is one of this type of meditation.
By witnessing your emotions, always be aware of your emotions like anger,hatred,fear, jealousy and choose positive emotions like gratitude, compassion, forgiveness.Transform your poisons into nectar.
By witnessing your thoughts - you can meditate by witnessing your thoughts. There are gaps between thoughts. That is where meditation happens. If you meditate for years then one fine day one of the gap will become permanent and you will enter state of no-mind - utter silence."
"Does spiritual awakening make someone mad? I had become mad for one and a half year. Someone started to talk in my mind. Now, I am in depression.","Most of the time this happens and you are one of few fortunates.
When one is on the verge of going mad then suddenly one day enlightenment arrives. This is nature's way to prepare your body and brain for the greatest happening of the life.
Most probably there is blockage at your heart chakra. This is also called 'dark night of the soul'.
If you practice love, compassion, forgiveness and let go grace will be showered by the God.
Here is complete detail about stages of spiritual awakening :-
Swami Jai Deep's answer to Practicing meditation for almost 7-8 years, Recently whenever I meditate I feel like I'm about to die, all my perception of time physical body and gravity looses, such a weird and SCARY feeling, what should I do now should I stop meditating? HELP"
"Which meditation can help one to see the chakras, and when?","Chakras are to be felt not to be seen.
Let's get straight to the point - there is only One way to activate chakras.
By transcending mind and becoming witness.
There are three ways you can practice witnessing :-
By witnessing your activities(walking,talking,eating) and be aware of natural needs of the BODY like hunger, thirst,lust (specially). Live here and now.
By witnessing your emotions, always be aware of your emotions like anger,hatred,fear, jealousy and choose positive emotions like gratitude, compassion, forgiveness.Transform your poisons into nectar.
By witnessing your thoughts - you meditate by witnessing your thoughts. There are gaps between thoughts. That is where meditation happens. If you meditate for years then one fine day one of the gap will become permanent and you will enter state of no-mind. This is called Samadhi. Permanent transcendence of mind.
In the state of no-mind you will be able to actually feel your chakras. Through mind, it's all mind games.Always Meditate by witnessing.
Why does it work?
When you hit your mind 10000 times with positive emotions and thoughts and you live in now. One day mind surrenders and you attain state of no-mind - the key to mysteries of this existence.

"In a dream, we create a world along with us and when we are awake, the dream work is gone and then we are in the waking world. Does it show that we are all one single form of pure consciousness?","Absolutely not. This verifies that man lives in dreams. Dreaming is very nature of our mind because consciousness doesn't dream in fact consciousness doesn't have memory storage. Only mind lives in past and future.
Consciousness lives here and now.
That is why Hindus say this world is Maya - illusion.
Man lives his life unconsciously. Man lives his whole life hypnotized. You see a pretty woman and more you see her more attracted you become to her and then your mind starts weaving imagnery situations like Sheikchilli.
That is how one lives his whole life hypnotized, weaving plots and becoming a character.
Mind is Mungeri Lal."
What is Kundalini Shakti? Is it possible to activate? How Do we get call from energy? How to raise this energy?,"You can get initiated by 1) Shaktipat 2) Pranapat , 3) Shivapat.
Shortest and easiest path to divinity."
"Can I replace sleep with meditation (absolutely being still, perceiving not even a vibration)? I'm concerned if it'd affect physical health of the body. Experiential advice would be greatly helpful. Thanks so much..","Absolutely not. There are three states of our being - Waking, dreaming and sleeping (deep sleep or sleep without dreams / contents).
Normally one requires 2–3 hrs of deep sleep and it can be completed by sleeping 7–8 hrs. You need to sleep at least 7–8 hrs a day.
Only an enlightened person can complete the deep sleep while waking.
Here's the catch :-
The fourth state is Turiya. Turiya means fourth. Turiya has something of waking and something of sleeping. Sleeping not in the sense we know. Sleeping means state of no-mind.
When we touch deep sleep unconsciously it is sleep without contents.
But enlightened being can be in state of no-mind while awake. That means he can enter deep sleep consciously and this is Turiya.
If you are yet not enlightened , you will have to sleep for 7–8 hrs a day."
Why do I see shadows like human beings in my room casted by objects and are clearly visible all time and I feel that they look at me all the time?,"There is imbalance in your Hara Chakra. Hara chakra is related to death and death chases everybody like shadow throughout life.
People are afraid of two thoughts , thought of death and fear of going mad.
These both fears are related to Hara Chakra.
There are many solutions which include therapy , your diet and regular exercise regime."
"Suggesting J. Krishnamurti said, “the observer is the observed”, but other spiritual teachers say that the witness is separate from the witnessed. Can someone explain the difference?","These two situations refer to before and after enlightenment.
Before(pre) enlightenment : Mind is witness (observer) and there is subject or object of witnessing. Mind is bridge between consciousness and object or subject of witnessing.
Hence the statement :The witness (observer) is separate from the witnessed.
After (post) enlightenment : Mind (observer) is bypassed and it is also observed by the consciousness inclusive of subject or object of the witnessing.
Hence the statement -Observer(mind) is observed (by consciousness)."
"How does ""listening"" to different frequencies of om chanting help?","OM is not right word to chant. Right word is AUM. Universe is a reverbrations of energy. AUM means Absolute Universal Mind- Cosmic Consciousness.
There are three states of our being - waking, dreaming and sleeping.
When you chant the three syllables of A-U-M, you will experience vibration in your body at three spots named below.
When you chant AA: You will experience the vibration around your navel and abdominal area. It is related to the waking state.
When you chant UU: You will experience the vibration in and around your chest cavity. It is related to the dream state.
When you chant EEMM: You will experience the vibration in and around your throat. It is related to the state of deep sleep.
The fourth state is Turiya. Turiya has something of waking and something of sleeping. Sleeping not in the way you know. Sleeping means state of no-mind.
After you chant one Aum, there’s a pause. This gap represents Turiya, or infinite (cosmic) consciousness.
Chanting AUM takes you to state of no-mind - the utter silence.
State of no-mind is also called Samadhi. Once one attains permanent state of no-mind , he/she becomes enlightened."
Which is the best book for meditation in Hindi?,
How do I tackle a saint (Fraude Baba)? He and his gang are doing Tantra Mantra in my village while innocent people are totally covered with its ill intentions.,"If they are fra?d baba then you don't have to do anything they will go away on their own.
But if they are Siddhas and know black magic then there is trouble and there is no way to escape.
Immunity from black magic is impossible as tantra and black magic uses same doors and windows to control your mind and consciousness.
Though you can minimise the effects of the black magic by practicing mindfulness and prayer. With meditation and prayers energy becomes dense and clouds of dense energy are nearly impossible to manipulate. To manipulate dense energy one has to apply more psychic force which might not be available to everyone.
But relax no Siddhas will do harm and 99.99 % babas are showmen.
Enjoy what they do like you enjoy theatre."
How should I get rid of the attachment with a web series which I have just completed? Its story and music are roaming in my mind and I am not able to concentrate.,"If possible, re-watch the series but now watch it as a witness. Treat it as a play. Don't get involved in characters and script. Don't even try to relate your life to storyline.
Sit back , watch it on a biggest screen available to you not the smartphone. Smartphone are very good in keeping your attention concentrated/focussed."
"Whenever I read spiritual teachings and watch spiritual videos, my ego automatically says me to not trust the teachings, thus not allowing the teachings to penetrate deeply in me. How do I overcome this problem?","Only perfect ego can surrender. You can give what you have. Higher the threshold deeper will be the surrender.
Doubt is not hurdle, it is self-respect of your intelligence. Your ego wants to make sure viability of the teachings before they become part of your being.
The day you will come accross something deeper than your ego, your quest for truth will be over and you will enjoy the freefall."
What do spiritual masters have to say about conservation of biodiversity? It does not seem to be a primary concern.,"Spirituality is an individual affair. It has got nothing to do with biodiversity or ecological systems.
Spirituality is all about seeking one's true-self. Even spirituality and religiousness has no relation. Going to temple is not spirituality , it is sheer religiousness.
Similarly enlightenment and bugging of bed has no relation.
Enlightenment simply means - “ I know myself.”"
What has religion given to mankind? Will all countries have an age of reasoning?,"Religion has given everything to mankind except pure consciousness. Religions have given long history of blood and wars.
People lead to unconscious life because of religion. But sometimes some people awakened and delivered their message like Buddha, Mahavir, Guru Nanak, Jesus, but we missed the messages of those great souls.
Religion is pseudo till we understand and start living the teachings of religions.
We choose this against that. We keep repeating the mistakes of past and never live life of awareness and love.
Religions are there for humans not that humans are for religion.
In fact religions are mini programs (programming) or conditioning of our brain to control the choas of the society by politicians and priests. That is why we have hundreds of religions.
Thanks to internet for expanding our consciousness. Religion of future will be shaped by the people of pure consciousness where love and value of human life will be the only criterion."
How does the soul enter into a newborn baby?,"There is no soul. Ask yourself do you have soul? If 'yes', do you have any realisation of soul.
Soul is just primitive concept to reinforce immortality of humans. Fascination of soul is the food for ego. Only your DNA remains in your kids after your death.
Death takes away everything including your sorrows and pains."
How can anyone check someone's spirituality level or meditation level?,"Here is complete roadmap to spiritual awakening :-
Six stages to Enlightenment.
There are six layers of the ego (personality) and when we meditate for many years the layers are peeled like peeling an onion.
Frederick S. Perls has listed six layers of ego in his book :- Ego, Hunger, and Aggression.
Here are list of layers :-
Layer one : In this people live artificial life like if they go to funeral they cry with others but their tears mean nothing. They say Hello but to avoid people. This layer is called CHICKENSHIT.
Layer two : This layer is pure ego. It is like - I AM PRESIDENT OF AMERICA. I AM HUSBAND OF MISS UNIVERSE. People in this layer are bit better than layer one but dangerous because they become politicians, police officers etc.This layer is called BULLSHIT.
Layer three: When something bad happens in layer two like death of loved one or divorce then people like poets, authors, musicians, lyricists or people good at heart fall to third layer. This layer is called CHAOS. Here people either become alcoholic or druggist or go back to layer two.If one remains meditative and aware then he enters next layer.
Layer four: This is DEATH layer ,where you touch death experiences of yourself and your loved one.If one remains aware in this layer by meditating then he or she enters LIFE phase. To be frank, in this layer you need a MASTER who can give birth to your new ego otherwise you will move like zombie or you will revert to layer two.When this layer is being peeled this is Awakening of Heart Chakra. This is also called 'dark night of the soul'. This term was first mentioned in a poem written by the 16th-century Spanish mystic and poet St. John of the Cross. From here you are most likely to descend or transcend. Be careful and remain aware. This space is to help you understand this phase and aftereffects.
Layer five : This layer is called LIFE. Your new ego has to take new form and new dimensions of loving and compassionate life.You can become epicurous or Buddha, if you remain aware.From here MASTER can't help you. You will be guided by your wisdom.
Layer SIX: This layer is called BLISS. If you come to this layer then you have possibility of becoming BUDDHA- full of pure love and awareness.
Break the shell of every layer before you experience first SATORI and then Enlightenment."
Does enlightenment really exists or is it just the brim of wisdom? Because I think that it is just wisdom & no breakage of life and death.,"Certainly there is NO breakage of life and death. Enlightenment is just a word like you have name.
It is certainly a BRIM OF WISDOM. But the question is how this brim of wisdom happens to some?
Because there is something we all possess and enlightenment is uncovering that something just like undusting an old book.
Now the real spinner :-
Enlightenment is our true nature. We are already enlightened. Enlightenment is all about undusting cluttering of mind and attaining state of no-mind.
We have three states of mind - waking, dreaming and sleeping. Fourth is not state it is our nature called Turiya. Turiya has something of waking and something of sleeping. Sleeping not in the way we know. Sleeping means state of no-mind.
We touch the state of no-mind every night in deep sleep, but we go into that state of no-mind unconsciously. Turiya is living in the state of no-mind consciously- fully aware.
Once you attain the state of no-mind permanently, you start living in Turiya - the fourth - permanent state of bliss. Bliss - where all your questions become answers - that is what you know as wisdom.
ENLIGHTENMENT - transcending mind and diving into infinite cosmic consciousness."
How do you know if you are suppressing your emotions responses or if they really stop bothering you anymore due to self-realisation?,"This question is coming out of your mind so take it from me they are bothering you.
Emptiness is the only virtue self-realisation can bring to your being, everything else is mind games."
What is the truth behind the gratitude list published by Rhea Chakravorty?,"Tug of war (also known as tug o' war, tug war, rope war, rope pulling, or tugging war) is a sport that pits two teams against each other in a test of strength: teams pull on opposite ends of a rope, with the goal being to bring the rope a certain distance in one direction against the force of the opposing team's pull.
Rhea will win because she has got the edge(okay Sushant’s Money..…).
It’s all about money , honey."
How much can life change after accepting a spiritual path?,"Accepting spiritual path officially is like pretending to love someone for sex. There will be change outside but inside will be full of repressions.
Spiritual path is not choice it is a call, call of your true-self. It is a call of your being. Word 'change' is ego based and spirituality is all about transcending ego and finding true-self.
Expectations are the way of material world. Desirelessness is the way of spiritual world. You can't be spiritual till you expect anything including desirelessness."
Has anyone achieved 'nirvana' during his lifetime? How was that experience? Does that have anything to do with the philosophy of Acharya Rajneesh?,"Nirvana,moksha, Fanna , god-realization, self-realisation or enlightenment, these are same name of divine nature everyone is gifted with as a human.
Everyone is potentially enlightened. Buddha, Mahavira or Osho were as human as you are. They were not any different. Only difference between you and them is they realised their true-self and you are yet to realise your true-self.
Enlightenment is our true nature everything else is a layer upon layer as an ego. Once you transcend the limited ego you will dive into infinite consciousness - that is what people know as Nirvana.
Most of the answers here are from people who will suddenly change their answer once they find their true nature.
Does that have anything to do with the philosophy of Acharya Rajneesh?
I am really happy that you used name Acharya Rajneesh not Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh or Osho. Why?
What I have realised that his early days work is downright authentic (till 1970) and his work is of great value as his work is straight to the point of enlightenment. Thereafter his work got polluted because nobody likes the raw food so he started cooking things just to make people interested and have more disciples. He also confirms that in following quote :-
“My old books are immensely important. Unless you understand them, you will not be able to understand me. But remember, it is a constant flow and change, so don’t be bothered with inconsistencies, contradictions. If you go on, soon you will be able to find the truth. And once the truth is revealed, all contradictions and inconsistencies dissolve. Then you can see, crystal‑clear, that it is a single message from the roots to the flower. It is a single organism.” From the False to the Truth #11
And in his final days his work is authentic but underlying basic principles are based on teachings of Buddha and Vedanta (end of veda).
His most comprehensive work is on ASHTAVAKRA SAMHITA called Ashtavakra Maha Geeta. His commentry on Ashtavakra Samhita runs into 90+ discourses and more than 130+ hrs. It is longest commentary on Ashtavakra Samhita in the history.
Lastly, there is no fixed path to self-realisation you have to knock wrong doors also before you reach right door. But when you reach right door then wrong doors also make sense , because identifying wrong as wrong is also right. You will have to read and try to understand anything and everything, you will have to pick coals also till you identify diamonds. Sometimes two wrong will make right or maybe two right will make wrong. This is how the journey of self-realisation proceeds and finally ends somewhere, but the moment you reach home you say ‘thanks’ to everything and everyone you met during journey regardless of wrong or right.
PS: Don't make choices, neither this nor that can be complete. Only you are complete, because this is your journey to the truth."
Is spirituality means accept and ready for chances?,"Absolutely not. Spirituality means transcending duality of life by accepting life in its totality. Getting ready is a choice to accept something you consider bad and spirituality means being choiceless , neither this nor that. Spirituality means starting your journey inward to find your true-self."
"How do I overcome fear while meditating or experiencing something? When I felt that something is happening because it was my first time having anything different in meditation, I feared and opened my eyes.","Though experience of meditation varies person to person but everyone experiences fear at some point in meditation.
Let us analyse the situation:-
What is mind ?
Mind is chaos. Mind is chatterbox. Mind doesn't keep quiet even while we sleep. It has its persistent existence most of the time.
What is meditation?
Meditation is non-doing. Meditation is all about breaking out of the habit of doing. Witnessing your thoughts or your breath is meditation. When you meditate by witnessing there are gaps between thoughts and that is where meditation happens, that is where you attain state of No-mind for few milliseconds. Now here is the catch - your being touches consciousness directly without interference of mind. The state of no-mind is like death of mind. Mind resists its absence by causing hallucinations in form of fear, sensation and vibrations.
Though you touch that state every night unconsciously in deep sleep. But in meditation you are doing same consciously - fully aware. As you are accustomed to live in mind 24x7 any change in habit is natural to be bit upsetting.
No news is bad news. It is good that something is happening.Imagine if you simply go to sleep while meditating.
Not good!
One has to bear labour pain before the birth. Resurrection can't happen without pain of death.
Don't worry, say hello to everything you come accross good or bad during meditation.
No pain, no gain."
Will anyone help me by giving me guidance in meditation? I don't want to depend on YouTube videos or Quora answers.,"You will find many experts who will be able to guide you according to their knowledge and experience. What I guess you need a therapist not master or meditation.
Therapist can help you. You are certainly seeking but you seem quite confused.
If you want guidance of a master then you will have to surrender to master and become devotee or disciple."
"I am in class 12. What is most beneficial for my life, gymming along with meditation or yoga alone?","As these are your growing years gym is must because it will prepare your body for future ups and downs.
Yoga is for older people and girls.
Strength training will utilise all possibilities of your body growth. In this phase of life body produces maximum human growth hormones (HGH) and testosterones. You will be wasting all your precious years if you don't go to gym.
Meditation will make you calm and will help you utilise your energy in creative ways.
Gym and meditation is the way to go.
PS: I assume you are a boy while answering your question."
Why is meditation a reliable method for attaining a permanent state of enlightenment?,"The ultimate alchemy that happens on enlightenment has seeds in meditation.
We have three states of mind - waking, dreaming and sleeping. Fourth is not state it is our nature called Turiya. Turiya has something of waking and something of sleeping. Sleeping not in the way we know. Sleeping means state of no-mind.
What we know as witnessing in meditation is seed of Turiya. Once you attain the state of no-mind permanently- pure consciousness, you start living in Turiya - the fourth - permanent state of bliss. Bliss - where all your questions become answers.
ENLIGHTENMENT"
Why do we not consider the mind in the process of meditation?,"There are two players in the meditation. One is mind and other is consciousness. The very idea of meditation is to bypass the mind and experience this world through consciousness directly without the interference of the mind.
Mind plays important role initially and through mind only we can access consciousness.
When we meditate by witnessing our thoughts there are gaps of few milliseconds between thoughts and that is where we witness thoughts of mind by pure consciousness (that is where the meditation happens).
When one keeps meditating for years these gaps become larger and larger and one fine day one of these gaps of pure consciousness becomes permanent - that is when one attains samadhi - the state of No-mind.
This permanent state of no-mind is called enlightenment."
Is sharing meditation experiences good in the initial days?,"Sharing your meditation experiences is like sharing your experience of first night of marriage. Nobody is interested but you are so excited to share your experience with your close friends.
Meditation is an individual affair and varies person to person. If you share your experience of meditation with others then it interferes your meditation.
Here is answer to similar question :-
Swami Jai Deep's answer to Why does it happen that as soon as I experience something (while in meditation) I start imagining situations where I'm sharing it with my friends and relatives and then I'm distracted? Is it my ego?"
Do we need an awakening call or can we strive by ourselves towards spirituality?,"Awakening call is always there but because we keep living unconsciously, that is why we don't take notice of it. We are so busy in life that everything we do in the name of spirituality is so phoney.
Everyone is born with question mark in his heart. When one tries to find meaning of the question mark outside he turns worldly and keeps accumulating more cars, bigger house, new girl or more bank balance or gold.
When one starts seeking answer to question mark inside he becomes spiritual.
The inward journey is spirituality.
Though no wake up call is required to be spiritual but most of the times death of the loved one or break-up of relation is the wake-up call. Only in these situations one can see the futility of achieving and accumulating material things thus the genuine seeking starts. But out of thousands only one reaches."
Which mantra should be recited for someone who is suffering from spinal cord injury. As it is my 7 year old son who got this injury 2 years back in a car accident (Really appreciate help here)?,‘Lam’ is the mantra which connects our being to mother earth. One can chant 'Lam' while concentrating on the end of the spinal cord. Ideally this mantra is to be chanted in the morning and for seven minutes maximum.
Can Kundalini activation heal diseases?,"Absolutely. Kundalini awakening heals diseases like hypertension, kidney or galbalader stones, insomnia or any problem related to brain, migraine, liver problems.eyesight problems. It also minimizes the possibility of cancer.
Kundalini awakening completely changes the energy system of your body. All your sexual energy is utilised in the healing of your body functions.
Only downside of Kundalini awakening is the physical strength doesn't remain same as prana energy starts traveling upward. There should be great deal of diet control to maintain balance between apana and prana energy."
Can we say that a black hole in the universe is Shiva's mouth?,"Shiva is the sky not black hole. Shiva is the highest peak of consciousness.
If you read about Kundalini then you will know the deeper meaning of Shiva.
Kundalini is also called Shiva-Shakti. Where Shakti is goddess Parvati and Shiva is 7th Chakra of consciousness.
There are seven chakras in our subtle body and awakening of chakras is ultimate flowering of the humans.
Shiva represents cosmic consciousness that is why his colour is blue, blue like sky."
Which meditations would you suggest for experiencing pure consciousness?,"Let's get straight to the point - there is only One way to experience pure consciousness i.e. by activating your seven chakras. With each chakra awakening you get closer to pure consciousness.
You can activate chakras by transcending mind and becoming witness.
There are three ways you can meditate by witnessing :-
By witnessing your activities(walking,talking,eating) and be aware of natural needs of the BODY like hunger, thirst,lust (specially). Live here and now.
By witnessing your emotions, always be aware of your emotions like anger,hatred,fear, jealousy and choose positive emotions like gratitude, compassion, forgiveness.Transform your poisons into nectar.
By witnessing your thoughts - you meditate by witnessing your thoughts. There are gaps between thoughts. That is where meditation happens. If you meditate for years then one fine day one of the gap will become permanent and you will enter state of no-mind. This is called Samadhi. Permanent transcendence of mind.
In the state of no-mind you will be able to actually feel your chakras. Through mind, it's all mind games.
Always Meditate by witnessing.
Why does it work?
When you hit your mind 10000 times in 1001 ways with positive emotions and thoughts and you live here and now. One day your mind surrenders and you attain state of no-mind - pure consciousness."
How do I control the monkey mind in meditation?,"This question reminds me of beautiful Tibetan parable .
An old saint knew how to fly and he became very famous. A young man got interested in knowing the secret. He swore that he would devote his whole life to know the secret to flying. He started to live with the old saint.
………
After few months, tired of the young man, because twenty-four hours a day he was there…Finally the old man got fed up. He told the young fellow, “Today I am going to tell you the secret. It is not very difficult. It is very simple.”
He said, “Everything is hidden in the mantra —Om mani padme hum.”
The young man said, “ Don't fool me. This is the mantra everbody knows.”
The old saint said, “ I am going to give you the secret key to open this mantra nobody knows.”
The young man said, “Key? I have never heard that there is a key to open the mantra.”
“The key is, while you are repeating the mantra – just for three minutes – don’t let any monkey pop into your head.”
The young man said, “You seem to be an old idiot! In my whole life I have never thought of a monkey. Why should I think of one?”
He rushed down the stairs of the temple where the old saint lived. But strangely, even though he was not chanting the mantra, monkeys started coming. He would close his eyes and they would be there. He would run to this side and they would be there. They were not outside, they were inside his head. As far as he could see, only monkeys and monkeys.
Somehow he tried to sleep but all night monkeys kept crowding his head and the house.
By the morning he was so tired that he rushed to old saint and said, “Please take away your key. I am almost mad!”
The old man said, “That’s why I was not telling anybody, because the key is very difficult. Now do you understand why I was silent? Now it is almost impossible to take back the key.”
He said, “I don’t want to listen to a single word from you. You just take this key back and let me go home. And I don’t want these monkeys to follow me!”
The man dropped the mantra, he dropped the key. He closed his eyes and there was no monkey. He looked all around and there was no monkey. He tried just once on the way, to see what happens when he says Om mani padme hum and closes his eyes. And they were all coming, from all directions.
All your thoughts are monkeys. Never force any thought to go away; otherwise it will rebound with greater energy. And the energy is yours! You are on a self-defeating track. The more you throw it away the more it will come back."
Is Tantra a path for women?,"Tantra is path neither for man nor for woman. Tantra is path for the divine meeting of man and woman. Tantra takes life as a whole not in parts. Man and woman together makes this world go round.
Tantra will remain incomplete without either of two. That is why tantrics keep women with them. No tantric ritual can be completed in absence of woman or man.
Tantra is the dance of male and female energies."
What happens if we could touch 100% consciousness?,"If you touch pure consciousness for few seconds or minutes, that is called Satori - the glimpses of enlightenment.
Before enlightenment one experiences many Satori. Once one gets permanently rooted in pure consciousness attains enlightenment.
Experiencing world through pure consciousness is called state of enlightenment or spiritual awakening."
"Is my memory an important part of who I am, or can I be me without my memories?","From consciousness point of view you exist in present moment without your memories because consciousness doesn't have memory.
No human can survive without memory. Your very existence is because of your memory. You are your memory.
Even enlightened beings depend on memory and mind.
We can't imagine camera,computer, smartphone without memory then how can one be without memory?"
What happens when you do meditation for twenty years?,"If one has to meditate for 20 years then either his meditation is wrong or he is simply not fit for meditation.
Meditation is required to transcend duality where meditation and meditator becomes one and meditation is no more required.
And life itself becomes meditation.
Simply idea of doing meditation is not valid. Because meditation is all about non-doing. Doing is the way to move outward. Non-doing is the way to move inward.
It is absolutely necessary that one should understand what meditation is not than what meditation is."
How do I invoke Kundalini?,"Let's get straight to the point - there is only One way to activate chakras.
By transcending mind and becoming witness permanently.
There are three ways you can practice witnessing :-
By witnessing your activities(walking,talking,eating) and be aware of natural needs of the BODY like hunger, thirst,lust (specially). Live here and now.
By witnessing your emotions, always be aware of your emotions like anger,hatred,fear, jealousy and choose positive emotions like gratitude, compassion, forgiveness.Transform your poisons into nectar.
By witnessing your thoughts - you meditate by witnessing your thoughts. There are gaps between thoughts. That is where meditation happens. If you meditate for years then one fine day one of the gap will become permanent and you will enter state of no-mind. This is called Samadhi. Permanent transcendence of mind.
In the state of no-mind you will be able to actually feel your chakras. Through mind, it's all mind games.Always Meditate by witnessing.
Why does it work?
When you hit your mind 10000 times with positive emotions and thoughts and you live in now. One day mind surrenders and you attain state of no-mind - the key to mysteries of this existence."
"Is it true that every time one reincarnates, they meet their soul mate once again but in a different physical form?","Reincarnation is product of the man in the search of permanence from death and soulmate is to reinforce the very nature of the man of possessiveness.
There is little salt in these two concepts and man loves to live in fairytales. That is why hindus call this world MAYA - illusionary.
People keep inventing words like soulmates, twin flames or spirit guide just to feel comfortable.
Have you ever thought deeply - “What is soul?”
Just think about it and don't take words from others. If you will be able to find answer to it then you will not need to ask about reincarnation and soulmates not even twin flames."
Is the pituitary gland meditation safe? Does it cause hormonal imbalances or acromegaly?,"Meditation is art of silencing your mind. Meditation and pituitary gland are not directly related. But if you start working with your Kundalini by awakening your Chakras then that is going to mess around with pituitary gland and causing hyper low and high of free testosterones and human growth hormones (HGH).
Ordinarily sexual energy travels downward to sex centre but if you are able to channelize sexual energy upward then it is going to open door to divine.
Because Kundalini works according to the wisdom of natural body systems there are no reported case of acromegaly or hormones imbalance."
Does mathematics really exist in the universe or is it just a way to observe the universe? Why?,"Mathematics is framework to understand this universe. That is why we have different signs to denote digits in different languages.
But mathematics has the bases in human evolution e.g.
Why do we have base 10 numeric system?
Because we have ten on our hands (8 fingures and 2 thumbs) likewise we have developed a numeric system to understand universe."
I am class 12 and wanted to do gym along with meditation. Is it good?,"Any kind of physical exercise like gym,yoga aerobics is good for physical health. As gym is good option because strength training makes you physically strong and brave.
Meditation is good for inner development it will give you calm, serene and focused mind.
The trick is to maintain balance between two. Never overdo anything. Never expect quick results. Always do something worth for its value not to show others.
When you look good , you feel good."
Is it possible that meditation has changed my musical taste?,"Music is form of meditation. A meditative person likes to find silence in the music. For meditative person music happen between the notes.
Bauls in Bengal only sing songs in the name of God. Kabir used to sing with ektara. Guru Nanak used to sing for God.
Music and meditation has great relationship. The change of taste of music is natural, of course you won't like Hard Rock, Metal or rap as a meditator."
How can a meditation practiser generate a sixth sense ability between him?,"Meditation and sixth sense does not have direct relation. Meditation is just one of several parts to awaken sixth sense.
Sixth sense can only be activated by awakening Third Eye (also called Agya / Ajna chakra).
Sixth sense is associated with third eye and it can be opened by opening lower 5 chakra.
All in all if you want siddhis like Lord Shiva then you will have to awaken kundalini.
Kundalini is also called Shiva-Shakti."
"Does ""Brahmacharya"" help in spiritual development?","Brahmcharya is unnatural. Yogi says sex urge is prana energy gone wrong. Better way is to transform sex energies into higher purpose.
Tantra says one can transcend sex energies either by over-indulging in it or transforming it into other higher purpose.
Like wrestler transforms sex energies into strength and endurance.
You can also transform your sex energy into Kundalini energy (Shakti) and awaken higher chakras Ajna and Sahasara chakra to experience divine."
Why am I having lusty and negative thoughts? I have started meditating 3-5 days back.,"Lusty thoughts are because of your natural instinct of sex and negative thoughts are resistance of your ego/mind in form of fear.
Whenever you start having lusty or negative thoughts just watch it . Don't be against it watch it without prejudice. Without taking standpoint just watch silently , neither for nor against and within minutes thoughts will dissolve and only great silence will be left behind.
You are lucky that within 3–4 days you are able to observe thoughts and their nature.
Best of journey."
Have you seen anyone paying back his bad karma in this life only?,"Feeling of karma payback is misinterpretation of coincidence. There is nothing as such karma payback. Life exists in duality like day and night, happy and sad, love and hate, light and darkness.
You can't appreciate love if there is love only and no hatred. You can't appreciate happiness if there is only happiness no sorrows.
Feeling of karma payback is a the food for your ego. It exists as a retreat of ego in case of defeat and helplessness"
"Can a graduate student start Brahmacharya? If yes, then could you elaborate with steps?","Brahmcharya is unnatural. Yogi says sex urge is prana energy gone wrong. Better way is to transform sex energies into higher purpose.
Tantra says one can transcend sex energies either by over-indulging in it or transforming it into other higher purpose.
Like wrestler transforms sex energies into strength and endurance.
You can also transform your sex energy into Kundalini energy (Shakti) and awaken higher chakras to experience divine."
Do you ever feel karma to you?,"Feeling of karma is misinterpretation of coincidence. There is nothing as such karma payback. Life exists in duality like day and night, happy and sad, love and hate, light and darkness.
You can't appreciate love if there is love only and no hatred. You can't appreciate happiness if there is only happiness no sorrows.
Feeling of karma is food for your ego. It exists as a retreat of ego in case of defeat and helplessness."
How can I achieve higher consciousness through meditation? Can you provide any tools and tips?,"Let's get straight to the point - there is only One way to achieve higher level of consciousness i.e. by activating your 7 chakras. With each chakra awakening you get closer to pure consciousness.
You can activate chakras by transcending mind and becoming witness.
There are three ways you can practice witnessing :-
By witnessing your activities(walking,talking,eating) and be aware of natural needs of the BODY like hunger, thirst,lust (specially). Live here and now.
By witnessing your emotions, always be aware of your emotions like anger,hatred,fear, jealousy and choose positive emotions like gratitude, compassion, forgiveness.Transform your poisons into nectar.

Why does it work?
When you hit your mind 10000 times with positive emotions and thoughts and you live in now. One day your mind surrenders and you attain state of no-mind - the key to mysteries of this existence."
What are the downfalls of spiritual awakening?,"There is no free lunch. Spiritual awakening comes with many pitfalls. Most dangerous and common is 'dark night of the soul'.
Most of the people face 'dark night of the soul'. When emotional clinging is very strong then one moves like a zombie for years and goes through lot of Complex-PTSD (Post Taurmatic Stress Disorder).It can be dangerous to an extent of suicide. At this stage one needs supervision of a master. This is also called awakening of heart chakra.
Second stage is third eye (agya chakra) here the energy of both eyes is redirected to pineal gland and thus opening third eye. With opening of third eye , eyes become super-sensitive rendering one to be confined indoor for few weeks.
Despite all pitfalls it is worth trying to attain divine life."
"Meditation helps us to clear our mind and find ourselves. Ancient Greek philosophers believe that ""you are whatever you think you are"". How would you resolve this contradiction as both if them have failed to be turned out false?","What ancient Greek philosopher said is true according to their understanding. Western countries explored outer world while east has explored inner world.
What Greek philosophers said , they said it at the level of mind.
What east says, they say it at the level of consciousness.
One can have many layers of ego. Like when one is at home he is boss and acts like a boss. But when one is in office he acts like a subordinate. What Greek philosophers are referring is ego - product of mind.
What east is referring is consciousness.
At the level of consciousness we are without the fake Identity - that is what meditation helps one to reach."
I’m an Indian Buddhist. I want to learn Buddhism and become a warrior monk. Which monastery is best?,"Indian Buddhists ? Learn Buddhism? Warrior monk?
Your whole question is childish. Buddhist is budhhist not indian Buddhist. Learning Buddhism ? Buddhism is to be lived not learnt. Warrior monk and true Buddhism has no connection.
It was later in Japan added by the monasteries to supply warriors to the king, otherwise Buddhism is a path to self-realisation or Buddhahood."
I want a life of spirituality and do good deeds in life. How can I start my journey?,"Doing good deeds according to scriptures is religiousness not spirituality. Spirituality means seeking your true-self. Being good human being and spirituality has no connection.
Being spiritual means being selfish. Selfish not the way you know. Selfish means searching for truth of oneself. First knowing yourself then peaching the same to others like Buddha did.
Cause of our sorrows and sufferings is our ego. Transcending ego/mind is spirituality.
Spirituality happens automatically on its accord. When one wears because of sufferings then he becomes spiritual."
"When I am performing my worldly duties, my mind is focused on God, but when I sit to do meditation, the mind wanders. Why?","Let me break your question into two.
When I am performing my worldly duties, my mind is focused on God.
When you are performing worldly duties you are using God as a device of distraction. You are neither in your work nor into God.
But when I sit to do meditation, the mind wanders. Why?
When you meditate the same habit of mind is dragging you to worldly affairs.
There is nothing wrong this is the very nature of the mind. We all spend all our life unconsciously by distracting ourselves from the present moment in favour of past or future and sometimes God.
The solution to your problem is start developing habit of living here and now.
When you are into worldly matter, be there whole heartedly. Your work will become your meditation.
Forget meditation for few months and relax into present moment."
How can anyone be possessed by black magic even when he is unwilling and does not believe or cooperate in such experiments?,"Cooperation is required in hypnosis and tantra. We have five bodies.
Annamaya kosha -- the food body, the earth body.
Pranamaya kosha -- energy body- body of your breath.
Manumaya Kosha -- the mental body.
Vigyanamaya Kosha -- consciousness.
Anandamaya Kosha -- Bliss body.
Black magic starts working on your 4th body, i.e. your consciousness bypassing your mental body and then affecting your 5th body i.e. bliss body thus your involvement is irrelevant for black magic.
Why does it work ?
This world is an expansion of energy, and life is the crystallization of that energy.What we see as stone is also energy, what we see as life, what we experience as mind/thoughts, what is felt like consciousness, is transformation of energy. The whole cosmos is manifestation of the same energy in infinite forms and ways."
Should Kundalini meditation be practiced by everyone?,"Playing with Kundalini energy is dangerous affair. If it gets stuck at heart chakra then one moves like a zombie for years or decades. Sometimes in extreme cases mishandled kundalini can result in suicide.
It is preferable to practice kundalini meditation under supervision of the master."
At which amplitude/frequency can we hear someone’s inner voice?,"You should be at 211.44 Hz i.e. your Sahasara Chakra should be open and subject should be at 141.27 Hz Vishuddha (throat) chakra or at 221.23 Hz Anahata (heart) chakra.
Your consciousness will establish direct connection to subject's mind which is always result of heart.Other thoughts are result of illusionary ego and the final decision is always emotional from the heart."
"Is there any way of self-realization for me as I don't like to chant, perform rituals, and worshiping?","You are already enlightened. Enlightened beings also don't chant, perform rituals or worship.
This is what self-realisation is all about-transcending rituals, religion and God also. If you are already blissful then you don't need to bother about self-realisation.
Seeking for self-realisation is medicine for poor souls. Though self-realisation is blissful state and flipside is you may attain self-realisation or you may not. It is always 50/50.
Eat, drink,sleep and be merry."
Is the spiritual and scientific meaning of energy the same?,"Meaning of energy is exactly the same in spirituality and science. Science just verifies what was observed thousands of years ago by spiritual traditions like tantra and yoga.
Here are few quotes to illustrate :-
“The world is an expansion of energy, and life is the crystallization of this energy.What we see as stone is also energy, what we see as life, what we experience as mind/thoughts, what is felt like consciousness, is transformation of energy. The whole cosmos is manifestation of the same energy in infinite forms and ways.”
""A human being is part of a whole, called by us the 'universe', a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings, as something separate from the rest -- a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affectation for a few people near us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circles of compassion, to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.""
The real brahmin is the one who has crossed beyond duality; ...knows not this shore, other shore, or both; ...(is) settled in mind ... without inflowing thoughts; ...is without attachment; ...endures undisturbed criticism, ill-treatment and bonds, (and is) strong in patience; ...(is) without anger, devout, upright, free from craving, disciplined and in his last body; ...has experienced the end of his suffering here in this life, who has set down the burden, freed! - Buddha
“Reality is merely an illusion, albeit a very persistent one.”"
"How do I control the flow of energy from the heart to the head? I have certain headaches and the energy flow from heart to head is leading to giddiness, headaches, and stopping meditation in between.","This condition happens when there is energy blockage at heart chakra.
Here is solution:-
This condition also gives your body specially your hands Reiki quality.
Now the main excercise :-
1) Tap your body with your hands so that you become aware of your body.
2) Put your right hand on back of your heart and left on right side like hugging and try to feel your body.
3) Put right hand palm on your forehead and left hand palm on your heart and breathe naturally focussing on your breath . Do it for 4–10 minutes.
The basic idea is to make your consciousness aware of your body.
Bring your consciousness back to body and to raise stuck engery from heart chakra to Agya chakra (third eye) to-and- fro.
These 3 excercises you can do anytime during day.

Why do people fear Tantriks so much?,"The terms black magic and tantra are used interchangeably but there is a difference in their applications. Black magic is negative side of tantra.
Tantra and black magic is manipulation of cosmic energy.
“The world is an expansion of energy, and life is the crystallization of this energy.What we see as stone is also energy, what we see as life, what we experience as mind/thoughts, what is felt like consciousness, is transformation of energy. The whole cosmos is manifestation of the same energy in infinite forms and ways.”
Anybody who has learnt to tame cosmic energies is capable of using it positively or negatively. Though magic is collecttion of tricks that is why we call it magic tricks.
But black magic and tantra is 100% truth.
Immunity from black magic is impossible as tantra and black magic uses same doors and windows to control your mind and consciousness.
Using tantra/black magic one can steal you consciousness/soul and use it against you to the point of your destruction.
Though you can minimise the effects of the black magic by practicing mindfulness and prayer. With meditation and prayers energy becomes dense and clouds of dense energy are nearly impossible to manipulate. To manipulate dense energy one has to apply more psychic force which might not be available to everyone."
"After Kundalini awakening, how much time is usually taken to show its impact on anyone’s personality or transformation?","Personality transformation starts happening well before Kundalini awakening. Personality changes occur at every chakra awakening but at heart chakra there are noticable changes in personality. Person becomes sensitive on awakening of heart chakra. He becomes pool of love and compassion.
Every chakra Awakening brings personality changes and on awakening of Sahasara Chakra all personality changes are consolidated permanently.
On awakening of Sahasara Chakra one enters Samadhi and he/she remains there for few days to few weeks. Once person returns from samadhi then his mind tries to recollect whatever happened in samadhi. Because mind is left behind before entering Samadhi. Mind works like camera capturing everything from distance without taking part in the process.
So changes are there but the subject will notice the changes after he returns from samadhi.
You can say it can be from 4 to 13 days after awakening of Sahasara Chakra."
How do I become a monk in matha like Sringeri Sharada Peetham?,"Becoming is a disease and becoming someone else is suicide. Why don't you remain Shivam Shukla?
Why do you want to run from yourself? Have you lost respect for yourself?
Everybody is unique in this world. God is very bad photocopier. He doesn't create one thing twice. Even your two eyes are different , though they look same.
Never try to be someone else. Be yourself."
Is there any harm in meditation if there is some negativity in you or your house?,"If you have some financial or emotional problem in your life then first either you have to solve it or accept it.
Meditation is beneficial in silencing your mind.

Meditation is not solution for sufferings.
If you are looking at meditation as remedy to end your sufferings. It is not going to help.
Meditation can be helpful for you to live balanced life.
Meditation can improve your awareness.
Meditation is not a magic wand , it is a knack."
"Is it possible to become free from the birth cycle to get salvation in Kalyug? If yes, how?","There is no such thing as Nirvana from birth cycle. Yes you can attain Nirvana from ego. Everything that is said about soul, reincarnation, Nirvana are framework to access pure consciousness without distortions of mind.
There are three states waking, dreaming and sleeping. There is fourth called Turiya or Samadhi. Turiya is hybrid of waking and sleeping. Sleeping not in the sense we know. Sleeping means state of No-mind.
In Turiya ( means fourth), one becomes master of his mind/ego. You can choose to use mind on demand and also choose not to use mind.
This is called enlightenment,moksha, Nirvana, Samadhi, Turiya and in Sufism Fanna."
I was a non-vegetarian but now I'm a pure vegetarian and I will be forever. How do I wash off my sins for eating meat according to Hinduism?,"There is nothing wrong in eating meat or having alcohol. Tantra says you can have anything if it doesn't affect your consciousness.
Now your consciousness has affected and it turned into guilt. Sin is the word invented by the priest. Consciousness doesn't know words of our language.
If you have already left eating meat then your consciousness will start feeling good in few months, because consciousness doesn't have memory.
Forget about past, live here and now."
I feel a shortness of breath every now and then. It isn't too bad but it still is pretty annoying. What should I do? Is this serious?,"I don't know the medical reason of shortness of breath. You should consult qualified doctor for that.
In spiritual world shortness of breath happens when there is lack of coordination between your consciousness and mind, sometimes your mind works slower than your consciousness then the shortness of breath happens.
I don't know the seriousness of it but some regular breathing exercises can eliminate this problem."
"Is there a link between ""chakra"" and ""kundalini"" to the spinal chord and vagus nerve?","Not directly. Spinal cord and vagus nerve are part of gross body and chakras and Kundalini are part of subtle body. Though each point in subtle body has a corresponding point in gross body.
If you improve prana energy in subtle body that would be reflected in gross body and if anything bad happens to gross body will affect subtle body.
Thus kundalini awakening improves the functioning of subtle body and gross body."
How do I start meditation to awake my Kundalini without any negative effects?,"Here is my answer to similar question:-

Why some people think that one should go for spirituality only when they are old?,"Spirituality is something that happens automatically. As humans we are programmed to earn name and money to be respectable in society. We run for meaning outside like big house, big car, more money, more degrees, more girlfriends etc. etc.
This is a journey for meaning outward. When something bad happens like death of loved one or divorce then one sees the futility of running for material things and the inward journey starts. This is the start of spiritual journey.
There are two types of worldly attachments one because of the material things like house,car, gold or money and second is because of relations. When one comes to a point where all this seems evanescent/impermanent, the inward journey of spirituality starts.
When one's being asks questions like “What is life?” Or “Who am I?”
The journey of the heart has started.
The answer to your question is though there is no age criteria for spirituality but people tend to be spiritually inclined towards 40’s of their life.
Curiosity for meaning of life is spirituality."
What are some good books for spiritual enlightenment?,"Spirituality and enlightenment are interconnected. If you start to travel path of spirituality then you are bound to seek enlightenment otherwise you are happy with what you are.
Seeking is required and reading books are part of that seeking. But you should go by your instinct. e.g. if you are facing divorce then read everything you get hold of about divorce. Don’t be bothered about inconsistencies, contradictions.
There are three paths to enlightenment :-
There are three ways to self-realisation -
1. Positiva ( yoga, Kundalini).
2. Negativa (Buddha's way).
3. Confusiva (Zen's way).
Confusiva :- When we get so many answers we tend to get confused and in confusion our mind has to grow to find more answers.
In great confusion, one is left with only one possibility that is enlightenment.
If you go on, soon you will be able to find the truth. And once the truth is revealed, all contradictions and inconsistencies dissolve.
Seeking is first step and reading books are part of it."
Do you believe in the preaching of monks and Lord Buddha?,"Gautama Buddha was scientist of Einstein's calibre. He gave new path(negation) to self-realisation without hypothesis of God and soul.
Gautama Buddha gave clear reasons for reincarnation. What Gautama Buddha said about universe 2500 years ago is verified by modern quantum physics now.
Gautama Buddha's teachings are scientific not philosophical.
Buddha's teachings are precise, concise and practical making it easy to follow.
Anyone who desires to attain Nirvana should follow Buddha's teachings."
Does suffering purify our inner mind?,"Sufferings happen because of clinging. If you can decode your sufferings , you will find the cause of sufferings is inside of you.
There are sufferings because of two clingings. First sufferings because of loss of material things like money, house or gold. Second sufferings can be because of loss of someone you loved (relations). But the bases of any sufferings is clinging not what happens.
Once you let your clinging go, you would be as happy as you were before sufferings.
Sufferings do make you better or bitter person because sufferings give your life a depth. Life would be monotonous without sufferings. Duality is bases of our life- day and night, happy or sad, love and hate etc. If you let your desires and clingings go you will start enjoying mysteries of life.
Neither life is question nor answer, it is a mystery to live."
Is the Buddha Power Store a scam?,"Buddha and power are two opposite poles. Any effort to control anything was never taught by Buddha. These all are appeals of achieving mind. These are ways of ego. Because ego always wants to achieve, dominate and desire.
Buddha always taught egolessness. People keep doing business in the name of Buddha, Krishna and Hanuman. People keep running from realities of life by buying things.
All the power one has is his own. No mantra, no bracelet, no statue, no tantra can give power or align power of the man.
It is not scam. It is business and all businesses create demand and then supply.
Buy one if it gives you some feeling of power but soon it will wear out."
Do I need to renounce my passions to get enlightened?,"Not at all. Renouncing one thing for other is not renunciation. That is what we do all life.. Renouncing your passion for enlightenment is like divorcing one lady to get married to other. Renounciation is old concept. It doesn't apply now-a-days.
More practical concept is disidentification. Never get identified with your ego.Never become your desires. Never become your position. Never become your goals.
Always remain witness to your role in society. As Hindus say this world is leela. That is why we have Rasleela, ramleela etc.
Only coward people renounciate. Ups and downs give depth to your life. Live your life to fullest so that you transcend your every desire."
What is the best mantra?,"Life is a quest not question, a mystery to live.
Live in answers not in questions."
"Why did Gautama Buddha gain the most popularity, even though there were many enlightened people after him?","Before Gautama Buddha there was three path to self-realisation.
Tantra
Karam yoga
Bhakti yoga
Gautama Buddha was first to attain self-realisation by negativa. All paths before Buddha were based on positiva.
Here is drill :-
#What’s the name of the first person to walk on the moon? Neil Armstrong, of course.
What’s the name of the second?
#What’s the name of the highest mountain in the world? Mount Everest in the Himalayas, right?
What’s the name of the second highest mountain in the world?
#What’s the name of the first person you ever made love with?
What’s the name of the second, third, fourth. . . ?
The first to occupy the position in the mind is going to be awfully hard to dislodge. Many followed path of Buddha and thousands attained enlightenment. Path of Buddha is practical and doesn't require you to study long Upanishads, puranas."
Does black magic and tantra Vidya exist? If yes than how to be immuned or cut it's effect?,"Black magic and tantra are one and same thing only difference is in the application. Black magic is negative side of tantra.
Tantra and black magic is manipulation of cosmic energy.
“The world is an expansion of energy, and life is the crystallization of this energy.What we see as stone is also energy, what we see as life, what we experience as mind/thoughts, what is felt like consciousness, is transformation of energy. The whole cosmos is manifestation of the same energy in infinite forms and ways.”

With meditation and prayers energy becomes dense and clouds of dense energy are nearly impossible to manipulate. To manipulate dense energy one has to apply more psychic force which might not be available to everyone."
Is it difficult for a spiritually awakened person to fall in love after or during awakening?,"During spiritual awakening one goes bershek and his mood swings like a pendulum. He is in kind of renunciation. He can't love but his sexual energy becomes dangerous and it might create some trouble.
Because any mental disturbance can only be released through sex only. This is natural phenomenon of human body. His energies behave like a tide on full moon night.
After spiritual awakening he becomes as silent as an ocean after the tide. After spiritual awakening one becomes vast pool of emptiness and from there he can only give away unlimited love and compassion.
Mathematics of his love changes to 2+2=2. He never runs out of love and compassion. Quality of his love changes from indulgence to benevolence.
He starts making love to whole existence. He remains blissful irrespective of circumstances and people around him. He carries an atmosphere with him wherever he goes. He becomes whirlpool and swallows up all negative energies around him and all everybody is left with is love and compassion.
Love has different meaning for spiritually awakened person."

Mind is chaos.Mind is chatterbox. Mind needs occupation 24x7.
What is mantra chanting?
Mantra chanting is activity. It is an occupation mind enjoys.
What is meditation?
Meditation is silencing of the mind. Meditation is witnessing of the thoughts. When you meditate there are gaps between thoughts and that is where meditation happens.
Mantra chanting can be done before meditation but not simultaneously."
Is killing a thousand ants a sin and a bad karma?,"Killing anything is not sin. But when we kill something or someone we are killing innocence inside of us. True nature of our consciousness is love, devotion and compassion. Look idea of kiiling 1000 ants (or you might have already killed 1000 ants) has brought you to Quora to ask question.
If we kill something ,indirectly we kill something inside of us. Sin is the word used by religious people to make you feel guilty. Don't worry about sin , worry about your consciousness."
"Is my uneven eyes noticeable to other people? When I see myself in a picture, I notice that my uneven eyes look obvious. But then, my friends say that I look beautiful and it’s not that obvious in photos","No two things can be exactly same. God is very bad photocopier. No two organs are exactly same in any body.
Look at your hands one is stronger than other. Look at you ears one is slightly different than other.
But when you notice it very closely then you come to know the difference.
Moreover people are least concerned about others they live life in their own world so no one notices you so minutely.
Everyone is beautiful in one or other way.
Is my uneven eyes noticeable to other people?
No, absolutely not."
What are the effects of awakening inside stomach?,"Though spiritual awakening is individual experience and varies person to person here are few aftereffects :-
#Body becomes as light as feather.
# Any eyesight problem is gone forever.
#Hypertension doesn't exist.
#Insomania doesn't exist as he can complete his sleep in 4 hrs.
#Due to upward movement of energy sex doesn't remain priority.

#Greed , hatred, anger and jealousy are gone forever.
Etc. etc. In nutshell Only thing he can't do - he can't fly and surprisingly in some cases one can fly also."
"Did Osho just propagate the ideas of Buddha, Mahavira, Krishna, Lao-Tzu, Kabir, Krishnamurti and others? Did he have anything original of his own to say?","Truth remains intact regardless of who experiences it. Buddha, Mahavir, Krishna,Lao Tzu, Kabir, Meher Baba, Tota Puri and Osho all experienced the truth of theirselves.
Truth of everbody is emptiness. Only thing that differs is how one expresses it and how he transmits it to the world.
Osho is real ocean of teachings for people of every religion. His unique way of incorporating humour to touch human heart can't be found in any teachings. His skill of storytelling keeps the listeners spellbound.
He always uses art of zen koans to make you overthink and then give in to the mystery like an one hand clap.
He integrated his message million of ways to hit the readers thousand times and deprogram their brain like a brain surgeon.
You will get the idea of his deep insight from following quote of OSHO:-
“My old books are immensely important. Unless you understand them, you will not be able to understand me. But remember, it is a constant flow and change, so don’t be bothered with inconsistencies, contradictions. If you go on, soon you will be able to find the truth. And once the truth is revealed, all contradictions and inconsistencies dissolve. Then you can see, crystal‑clear, that it is a single message from the roots to the flower. It is a single organism.” From the False to the Truth #11"
"Why do Kabir, Osho, Buddha etc live always joyfully?","Straight to the point.
There are three states of our being - waking, dreaming and sleeping. There is fourth state - turiya which is called God's state.
Turiya has something similar to sleeping and something similar to waking. Turiya is ‘waking sleep'. Sleeping not in the sense we know but sleeping means there is nothing to think about - the state of no-mind.
Turiya is blissful 24X7.
On enlightenment one enters turiya. That is why every enlightened being live joyfully.
*Turiya is not state actually it is our uncovered nature of being."
"How do I practice spirituality being a physicist? Is it possible to practice spirituality as a scientist, or do I need to become a monk?","Science won't be obstacle but scientific mindset will be obstacle. Science and spirituality are diametrically opposites.
Scientists study things by dissecting like in case of matter electrons, protons and neutrons and seekers can only see beautiful shapes and colours.
But with little regularity anyone can be great meditator. Everybody can't be scientist. But every scientist can be meditator.
Path of meditation is open to everyone. True meditator can only be meditator nothing else. Meditation gives you wings to be free from any identification.Start meditating and feel the silence of the mind.
Sannyas is a way to disidentify ourselves from worldly pleasures. You can live normal life yet disidentify yourself from worldly pleasures."
"According to the Puranas, what is the story of the origin of ""Apsara Urvashi”?","Story of Meneka apsara and Urvashi Apsara is metaphors detailing about the last hurdle one will face before Samadhi.
Before Samadhi mind plays last trick to tie seeker to this material world and if one can cross that hurdle then he attains Nirvana/Samadhi.
In these two stories Vishvamitra gives in to Menaka and Rishi Markandeya wins against Urvashi.
Urvashi and Menaka are present in everybody. Urvashi and Menaka are the name of your sexual desires, nothing else.
You encounter Urvashi and Menaka everyday , you just have to look inside."
Does silence mantra chanting too produce vibration as a sound?,"Silent mantra chanting doesn't produce vibrations because of sound but the vibrations of mind increases with different soothing quality.
Mind is vibrations. On silent chanting of mantra mind produces vibrations of higher frequencies in form of cosmic energy."
Can a scientist practice spirituality? Will science become an obstacle to the path of spirituality?,"Science won't be obstacle but scientific mindset will be obstacle. Science and spirituality are diametrically opposites.
Scientists study things by dissecting like in case of matter electrons, protons and neutrons and seekers can only see beautiful shapes and colours.
But with little regularity anyone can be great meditator. Everybody can't be scientist. But every scientist can be meditator.
Path of meditation is open to everyone. True meditator can only be meditator nothing else. Meditation gives you wings to be free from any identification.
Start meditating and feel the silence of the mind."
Are Indians spiritual?,"Going to temple or mosque is religiousness not spirituality. Believing in all-power God is matter of faith not spirituality.
Dramatically asking philosophical questions is 'foolosphy' not spirituality.
All the time people ask borrowed, readymade,bookish and stereotype questions in the name of spirituality.

This is not spirituality. This is deep sleep and living unconsciously.
Spirituality is asking existential questions. Questions that can transform you. Spirituality is seeking your true-self. Spirituality is going beyond illusions of mind. Spirituality is going beyond desires, religion and God also."
"From last few days whenever I am meditating through prayer to Shiv, I see black light passing in front of me. I feel as if someone is observing what I am doing.  Is it because he is the lord of the ghosts? Its scary. How do I manage this?","First thing first!
What is mind?
Mind is chaos. Mind is chatterbox. Mind doesn't keep quiet even in sleep. Mind is very crafty.
What is meditation?
Meditation is state of no-mind. When you meditate by witnessing your thoughts. There are gaps between thoughts and that is where meditation happens. If you keep meditating for years then one fine day , one of the gap becomes permanent and you enter state of no-mind permanently - this is called Samadhi.
So when mind is being subsided it resists like a little kid at candy shop. It makes all the excuses to get its own way.
The problem you are facing is one of the excuses mind is making to reisist its absence. If you continue meditating, mind will surrender and you will attain great silence."
"If Buddha was not an avatar of Vishnu, who said he was an avatar of Vishnu and what was the purpose of so saying? Was the purpose achieved or not?","Each and everything you hear or read is untrue. Avatar always happens as coincidence that two persons share same thinking and experiences.
Enlightenment is the only real thing rest everything else comes under category -strories and parables.
Human mind enjoys stories that is why we have novels, movies and storybooks etc.
How does it matter if he was Avatar or not?
YES, purpose has been achieved - Buddha managed to find path of enlightenment/moksha without concept of God and soul.
Be little selfish and live here and now."
How does a soul enter a mother's womb?,"Soul enters the womb like flame jumps from one tree to other in jungle fire. It has no substance in it, it is just a flame. It has no material in it, it is just pure energy, a quanta of energy, a certain quantity of energy -- it jumps from one tree and reaches to the other and the other is on fire.
Like unlit lamp catches flame from lighted lamp. No matter transfer just energy starts consuming fuel of other body/womb like a candle."
How does balancing chakras in the body release negativity and heal our minds?,"It is matter of practical no answer can be your experience and everbody is unique as his age,food,eating habits and stress are different.
Here is your chance to implement Chakra balancing practically :-
Chakra Activation Exercises-Working with inner energy."
"Why is it said, especially in India, not to tell about your enlightenment experience? Will jealousy of others towards you be an obstacle even if one reaches the highest state?","Jealousy of others is pretty unlikely as there will be nobody to believe your enlightenment as it is very rare.
Somehow If people start believing the truth of one's enlightenment. They become jealous and that is why -people threw stones on Buddha. People killed Jesus. People killed Socrates. America killed Osho.
Why?????
Every enlightened being is dangerous for people like priests and politicians. People who want to rule you. Politicians rule your body and mind , priests rule your soul. This is a mafia of prestige and power.
Enlightenment is always the result of rebillion nature. One who doesn't accept the things because of faith or beliefs. He has to inquire true nature of mind. He can stake his life to find truth of himself.
This society and religion keeps conditioning us to be useful to society. The very root of our society is rotten because society is selfish.
Selfishness is basis of our existence so as they sow so shall they reap.This vicious circle goes on. But society enjoys your slavery , your helplessness.
Any enlightened being becomes dangerous to business of temples, mosques, churches and synagogues. All religions were started by enlightened beings. New religion might supersede old religion. That is how all the business of religions will be affected. There is chance that enlightened being might get killed.
That is why Guru advises to remain quiet about enlightenment."
Is there a hype in awakening Kundalini?,"Kundalini awakening is as old as lord Shiva and it has not changed a bit. Our outside world keeps changing but our inner world is primitive.
The world you see outside there is similar and as vast as this existence a universe inside.
Kundalini awakening is ultimate flowering of human being. It is part of transcending human state and becoming God. The fact is if thounds start the inner journey only 2–3 reach there , that is why Kundalini awakening seems hyped. YES it is hyped but real thing."
How can I activate the third eye with simple 15 minutes of meditation?,"Activate third eye by meditating 15 minutes Only!!!
Nice headline for commercial copywriter.
Refresher:-
Invisible earrings were very popular in Paris. Everylady was crazy about invisible earrings.
A lady went to jewellery shop and asked for invisible earrings.
The jeweller was known to the lady , he took out nice box of invisible earrings and showed.
Lady saw the earrings and asked curiously. Are earrings there really?
The jeweller replied , “Since I know you there is nothing to hide. Invisible earrings are out of stock for 2 weeks but they are selling like hotcakes.”
So any answer to your question will be like invisible earrings."
Where do our belief systems work against scientific truth?,"Wherever the question is of God and religion you tend to ignore scientific truths. Whenever you move into unknown you tend to take action based on firmwired beliefs. Whenever you are taken aback by circumstances or persons.
Whenever your mind is unable to find corresponding perception box in your experiences you tend to take decisions/actions out of belief system."
Do heaven and hell really exist?,"First thing first.
Society, country, religion are names of collectivities. There is only individuals.
Heaven,hell are creation of the priest to control and make money from gullible people.
Whatever one can't have on this earth is projected in heaven. Rivers of somras and apsara who always remains 16 years old. On earth man carves for sex and alcohol and same is projected in heaven. If nobody has come back from heaven and hell then how do we know about heaven?
Borrowed truths are more dangerous than ignorance. In ignorance one may come to know the truth someday but borrowed truth are just a closed door or rather a thick wall. There is no chance to know truth if you believe the borrowed truth.
I can tell you from my experience God is not person. Life itself is God. Purpose of life is to live it fully.
My favourite song is “Imagine by John Lennon”.
This song has conclusions of happy and meaningful life."
Who are the richest monks (Samijis) in India?,"Nice question.
Every true monk is rich not richest. First lesson of every monk is to forego every race.
Rich richer richest is a race.
Rich and poor are just point of view and nobody can be richest but everybody is greediest.
But I know the poorest.
Poorest person is the one who changes his decisions based on amount of money is being offered."
"Is it safe to do all 7 chakras meditation by YouTube videos, or should I work on them one by one?","You should work on individual chakra and all seven chakras so that energy is not stuck at any chakra. You will also have to work on body also.
Here's my answer to similar question:-
Swami Jai Deep's post in Vigyan Bhairav Tantra
Swami Jai Deep's answer to How do I help myself during kundalini awakening?"
Where did the four noble truths come from?,"Asking questions which you know the answer of or you can google, just to increase views is only waste of your and other's time.
Ask questions which can transform you. Which can solve your immediate problem.
Asking right question is all you need to be successful in life."
If Hindu philosophy is about taking rebirth then what is the importance of doing Pitru Karma every year when departed souls would have taken rebirth and why do we say it reaches them?,"You are as old as human species on earth or anywhere else in the universe.
How?
DNA gets transferred from parents to children. That is how you got the chance to visit this beautiful planet called earth.

Ritual of pitru karma is act of gratitude. That is how you know yourself as part of this creation.

In the state of gratitude your existence is enriched. You become better person. You remember your roots. That is how we grow performing various rituals."
"How do you throw away the consciousness from the mind, like Tantra says and Osho says in his book, Book of Secrets? What is the technique to achieve no mind state?","There are three state of consciousness and mind combination -waking, dreaming, sleeping and the fourth is Turiya. Turiya means the fourth.
Waking is consciousness + thinking. Dreaming is also consciousness + thinking. Sleep(deep) is consciousness minus thinking. Turiya is consciousness minus thinking.
Turiya is also called samadhi.
Samadhi has something similar to sleeping and something similar to waking. Samadhi is ‘waking sleep'. Sleeping , not in the sense we know but sleeping means there is nothing to think about - the state of no-mind.
Turiya/samadhi is hybrid of waking and sleeping.
Waking
Dreaming
Sleeping
Samadhi/ Turiya
Turiya is not state of consciousness. Turiya is nature of our being normally we are not aware of.
Turiya is transcending of the mind (as master) - pure consciousness without distortions by the mind."
How do I know if I am doing the meditation correctly?,"You can't do wrong meditation. There is no such thing as wrong meditation. Either you meditate or think. If you are not meditating then you are thinking, concentrating or contemplating.
Meditation is non-doing. Doing is a way of moving out. Non-doing is a way of moving in to the centre of your being.
The trick to meditate is to become observer of mind.Meditation starts by being separate from the mind, by being a witness of mind. e.g. When you look at mirror , you will only see your face if there is a distance between your face and mirror, if mirror is too close to your face you won't be able to see your face. Likewise when you become observer/witness of mind then a gap is created between mind and witness/observer/watcher.
Watching is the key of meditation. Watch your mind. Don’t do anything – no repetition of mantra, no repetition of the name of god- As you watch, slowly mind becomes empty of thoughts; but you are not falling asleep, you are becoming more alert, more aware.
While witnessing there will be gaps between any two thoughts and as you keep meditating these gaps will become larger and larger and one day gap will become permanent - this is called Samadhi."
Why is the material world full of misery?,"Life is a pain. Desires and ambitions are the cause of the sorrows. Because we don't learn the basics and keep making same mistakes.
I met a person who was getting married fifth time and this time to the first woman he had divorced.
Do you see the absurdity? When four marriages couldn't bring happiness. Do you think fifth can do so.
NO….. Because this Sansar is bed of thrones. Whatsoever you get , you won't be satisfied.
More and more miserable you become with more and more achievements.
The nature of this world is not happiness."
Do soul mates exist? Are they real or fictitious?,"How does it matter if you use word soulmates, marriage or twin flames. It is simple trick of mind to invent new word to search permanence in relations.
Whatsoever word we invent the problems of relations will never change because we can't change ourselves. Domination, possessiveness and ego are our armours. We can't survive without them.
Refresher:-
A couple who were getting married in the government registrar's office. The man signed -- the woman had signed before him. As she saw the man's signature, she immediately told the registrar, ""I want a divorce.""
The registrar said, ""What has happened? You are getting married, you have just signed the marriage papers.""
She said, ""Yes, I have signed but things have gone sour already. Just look at the paper. I have signed in small letters and he has signed in such big letters, to show me who he is. This is the beginning of trouble -- I don't want to get into it."" The bigger letters already declare the supremacy, superiority of the man.
You can change words but not basic nature of the human beings.
Eat , sleep and be merry."
What was the goal of the Yogi during his meditations?,"As short-term goals there must have been many benefits like silent mind, great presence of mind, laser sharp focus and excellent memory.
Spiritually (long-term) ultimate flowering of the meditation must have been state of bliss - Turiya*.
How??
There are three states of our being - waking, dreaming and sleeping. Fourth is our nature and it is called Turiya (meaning the fourth).
When we meditate by witnessing our thoughts, there are gaps between our thoughts. That is where meditation happens.
If one keeps meditating for years then one fine day one of the gap becomes permanent and one enters samadhi - the state of no-mind. Thenafter one lives in Turiya forever.
Turiya - The ultimate flowering of meditation.
*Everybody experinces Turiya while having climax in sexual intercourse and my understanding says this is what inspired man to find way to remain in Turiya 24x7."
"Isn’t my soul pure if my thoughts go on during chanting and I fall asleep during meditation? If yes, then how can I be a genuine devotee?","First thing first.
What is mind?
Mind is chaos. Mind is chatterbox. It doesn't keep quiet even in sleep. So don't worry about thoughts.
I am assuming first you are chanting then meditating.
Chanting releases negative energy from body and mind.Meditation relaxes mind hence you feel sleepy. This is positive signs that meditation is working.
Particularly chanting causes energy surge in your body and meditation calms the energy so feeling sleepy is natural.
The important thing is to remain alert and aware otherwise the whole point of meditation will be lost.
You are not to feel guilty of not being pure, it is part of the process."
Is the material world a shadow of the spiritual world?,"Material world is avidya. Material world is Maya. Man lives hypnotized in material world.
You see beautiful woman, you get attracted and start a dream world of your own fitting every positive possibilities to get that woman.
You call it love, twinflames or soulmate but fact is you got hypnotized.
Similarly you live your whole life hypnotized by women, cars, degrees and money.
Spiritual world is reality where person is aware of impermanence of everything. There is no distortions of unconsciousness. You see what is, not what you want to see.
Reality doesn't change all that changes is your ability to see things as they are."
What is the ultimate achievement one may get by doing regular meditation practices?,"Physically there are many benefits like silent mind, great presence of mind, laser sharp focus and excellent memory.
Spiritually ultimate flowering of the meditation is enlightenment.

How can I empower myself through conscious choices?,"Conscious choice can only be made if you ask right question. Right questioning is the key to take conscious steps in right direction. Right direction will empower you towards your goals.
Always ask existential question which is concerned with you. When I say ‘you’ , it means ‘you here and now'. Never ask questions about past.
Right questioning is all you ever need to empower yourself."
"In mediation mind relaxes where as in concentration or in japa, does our body generate heat? Because I felt a kind of skin crack and buring symptoms in below the hip? Am I correct or its a health issue","Meditation and concentration are polar opposites. Meditation is non-doing and concentration is doing of mind, japa is doing of body. Relaxation happens by being inactive in meditation. Relaxation happens because of boredom in japa. But in concentration neither is there non-doing nor boredom.
Concentration and contemplation are matter of focusing. So there is no relaxation only strain. Concentration can cause heating around your eyes and crown.
Particularly japa increases heat of your body if you do it for longer period.
You can say japa activates sun of your body and meditation activates moon of your body."
Why do most people associate tantra shastra with black magic?,"Black magic is Tibetan and it is somewhat same and different to tantra. Because both cover the esoteric aspect of Spirituality. Tantra is about attaining self-realisation by body and sex. Black magic is used by Tibetan lineage.
Tantra is a religion without discrimination.
#Answer
If I tell you - In tantra , one can leave the body and while somebody is asleep, one can enter that body and can work upon the person. Even it is for the good.
It feels scary and somewhat something like black magic.
Basic working with energies and the results of both traditions are kind of esoteric. So tantra is equated to black magic."
How does music help in meditation?,"Like seven colours in 🌈 rainbow. Like seven days of week. Like seven skies. Like 7 wonders of the world. Like seven notes of music.
We have seven chakras in us. Every chakra corresponds to musical note as under ::-
Root chakra corresponds to 'C' note.
Sacral chakra corresponds to 'D' note.
Solar plexus chakra corresponds to 'E' note.
Heart chakra corresponds to 'F' note.
Throat chakra corresponds to 'G' note.
Third eye (Ajna) chakra corresponds to 'A' Note.
Crown Chakra corresponds to 'B' note.
We have music listener inside of us. When we meditate with music we become witness as inner listener. That is how meditation with music works the inner listener finds music of silence between the musical notes. The silence between notes that is where music happens to inner listener.
Genius musician composes the silence and normal musician composes notes."

Does spirituality matter in life?,"Spirituality grows out of freedom not out of compulsion. Man is free, so he can choose to be anything. All the animals are pre-programmed, only man is free.
One can remain comfortable with materialistic life or he can choose to transcend human life and explore unknown territory of divine.
Your life and its freedom is more important than anything in this world."
"What is a soul mate connection? How did you feel when you realized that a person was your soul mate? What are our feelings, emotions and intuition that time. Do they both feel that connection at the same time?","How does it matter if you use word marriage or soulmates or twin flames. It is simple trick of mind to invent new word to search permanence in relations.

How do I help myself during kundalini awakening?,"You can make changes to your diet. You can opt vegetarian diet. Light diet will help prana (energy) to move upward. Low cholesterol and low sugar diet is also helpful.
If you take non-veg diet then your lower chakras (root, sacral,solar plexus chakra) will be active and not allowing energy to move upward.

Is everyone's right to attain enlightenment?,"Absolutely No. Everybody is free to choose. Freedom to choose is basis of human existence and growth.
Being enlightened is as possible as being happy. But you will have to create conditions for enlightenment. e.g.
# You will have to meditate.
# You will have to be vegetarian.
# You will have to be witness to your activities and emotions.
You can't replace ‘possibility’ with ‘right’.
You can't replace 'freedom' with 'right'.
You can replace ‘possibility’ with 'seeking'.
Surprisingly we all are born seeker. Only thing that matters whether you seek outside or inside. If you seek outside you become as big as President of America and if you seek inside you attain enlightenment."
"What do you mean by enlightenment? When it happens, do you see things or hear voices? Just like seeing the creation and knowing all by seeing it. Or is it just a feeling with no visual and audio?","Enlightenment is unspeakable. The world of words, concepts and language can't explain the world of silence.
Mind is left at doorstep before entering Samadhi/enlightenment. During Samadhi , the objects of the experiences are not seperate from experiencer. Experiencer is dissolved as his ego evaporates. In Samadhi there is no space-time as there is no experiencer.
But these intense experiences of the seeker who has come out of Samadhi are inferred through recollections of the mind. Mind works like a camera capturing everything happening in Samadhi from the door.
There is a parable about Buddha. When Buddha attained samadhi. He didn't come out of it for seven days.
All the Gods gathered at his feet and requested Buddha not to remain silent. They said , “ So many people for lifetimes wait for someone to become a Buddha and deliver the message after coming back from samadhi, to speak and tell what he has known. Please speak.”
But Buddha said, “ There is no one left here to speak , there is no desire left to speak. Moreover what I have witnessed- it is hard for me to believe that it can be spoken and where is the chance of listeners understanding it?”
When Gods didn't agree, Buddha said, “I will speak; but these things that I may say to somebody , I myself would not have understood had someone else told me before my own realisation. So how would anybody else understand? Through my experience of Samadhi I have come to one more conclusion , that those who will be able to understand what I have to say can also reach without me; and those who would not be able to understand what I have to say- there is no sense in racking one's brain in front of them.”
Samadhi/enlightenment is experience of nothingness where seeker dissolves into existence.
So any description of enlightenment will be personal and will depend on inference by the mind."
What does enlightenment feel like? Is it like ‘excitement’ where one ‘only remembers’ it after he has experienced or does it feel like fear where he/she is in constant awareness of it?,"Enlightenment is unspeakable. The world of words, concepts and language can't explain the world of silence.
Enlightenment happens to nobody.
Mind is left at doorstep before entering Samadhi/enlightenment. During Samadhi , the objects of the experiences are not seperate from experiencer. Experiencer is dissolved as his ego evaporates. In Samadhi there is no space-time as there is no experiencer.
But these intense experiences of the seeker who has come out of Samadhi are inferred through recollections of the mind. Mind works like a camera capturing everything happening in Samadhi from the door.
There is a parable about Buddha. When Buddha attained samadhi. He didn't come out of it for seven days.
All the Gods gathered at his feet and requested Buddha not to remain silent. They said , “ So many people for lifetimes wait for someone to become a Buddha and deliver the message after coming back from samadhi, to speak and tell what he has known. Please speak.”
But Buddha said, “ There is no one left here to speak , there is no desire left to speak. Moreover what I have witnessed- it is hard for me to believe that it can be spoken and where is the chance of listeners understanding it?”
When Gods didn't agree, Buddha said, “I will speak; but these things that I may say to somebody , I myself would not have understood had someone else told me before my own realisation. So how would anybody else understand? Through my experience of Samadhi I have come to one more conclusion , that those who will be able to understand what I have to say can also reach without me; and those who would not be able to understand what I have to say- there is no sense in racking one's brain in front of them.”
Samadhi/enlightenment is experience of nothingness where seeker dissolves into existence.
So any description of enlightenment will be personal and will depend on inference by mind."
Is it healthy to sleep just 2 hours a day like Leonardo Da Vinci and Swami Vivekananda?,"Sleeping is the matter of deep sleep. Average person has deep sleep of 90 minutes to 120 minutes. Some can complete deep sleep in 6 hrs and some can't even complete deep sleep in 10 hrs.
Only yogi can complete deep sleep in 2 hrs. Rest of the people have to sleep at least 6 to 9 hrs to complete 1–2 hrs deep sleep.
Deep sleep is the dreamless sleep where mind takes actual rest otherwise sleeping is almost like waking."
Is it possible to become as enlightened as Lord Shiva for human beings?,"Lord Shiva was as human as you are. But Lord Shiva found the secrets of the inner universe. He is the greatest yogi and tantric till this date.
Do you know ? There is equivalent universe inside of you as outside. You just have to go inside and explore inner world with conviction and you will be amazed to find exciting inner universe. Once you taste the inner universe you will leave the desire to be Lord or anybody else."
How If I lay down on a loud speaker with Bramananda Swaroopa chant on for 24 hours will I attain mukti?,"Yes…..
It doesn't matter how long you lay down. It can happen in 5 minutes also. You are already mukt. You just have to discard the desire to attain mukti.
Because you can't make moksha your desire. Whatsoever becomes your desire becomes worldly and moksha is other worldly."
Where does Prana come from?,"The energy we have is derived from solar energy. The food we eat also comes because of solar energy. This energy is converted into sexual energy (libido) , sexual energy+breathing is prana.
Yogis say that prana has five different shapes,workings energy fields in you.What we simply know as breathing , world of yoga knows five divisions of breathing. First is prana,apana,samana,udana and vyana.
These are five prana manifestation in you, and each has different work inside. Prana is respiration, apana is excretion, samana is digestion and heat provider, udana is speech and communication and fifth - vyana is for coordination and integration. When fifth leaves the body, you die."
Why does the ego always want when we already have everything we need?,"There is analogy between ego and s3x. Like you can't have enough of s3x, you want more and more and in all the variety, ego wants more and more of everthing. Sometimes more cars, sometimes bigger cars. Ego tries to get something new in size or numbers.
Man is born empty. Emptiness is his core and s3x is driving force to fill him."
"Teja, if a fellow enlightened man comes to you and tells you he can't cope with society's customs and rules (due to health, lack of skills, inabilities) in order to make enough money to get by, what would you suggest?","Enlightenment is neither a concept nor thought. Enlightenment is ultimate flowering of the human being or non-theoretially realising true nature.
""Enlightenment is a destructive process. It has nothing to do with becoming better or being happier.Enlightenment is the crumbling away of untruth. It's seeing through the facade of pretence. It's thecomplete eradication of everything we imagined to be true."" -Adyashanti
Enlightenment happens when one has already learnt to live in every situation.
Money matters to awakened person to an extent as utilitarian. Enlightenment also enables one to do things better as he can actually see the reality without illusions of mind. All five senses improve to next level on enlightenment.
My suggestion to you is to find the job which you used to love to do before awakening. A job which can be your meditation. Don't try to fit people into your perceptions. Help them know their unconsciousness.
Remember :-
Enlightened being carries a world around him. He should let people know how to live consciously. Start living in answers not in questions.

Which one of Eckhart Tolle's books would you recommend the most to start with?,"You are asking question with answer inherited in it. When you have chosen to read book by Eckhart Tolle then why not read all the books by him. Something might click with you.
But the key is to start reading. Start seeking. Start your journey with anything that you are curious about."
"What are some tell-tale signs that someone is actually rich, though s/he may not show that off through her/his actions and words?",The question you have asked has come from your knowledge not from your ignorance. You are looking for a validation. This is what we can say first SIGN of one being rich.
How can one achieve Mukti?,"What is the best way to lose weight?
What is the best way to make money?
What is the best way to invest money?
What is the best way to learn German?
What is best way to stay fit?
But
What is the best way to get mukti?????!!!!!"
Is there so much (real) difference between the different methods and techniques of meditating? Is the kind of method the important thing or our persistence on the certain practice?,"There is only one meditation i.e. witnessing. All other meditations are either variations of it or not useful.
Witnessing improves your intelligence, focus and silence of your mind.
What is mind ?
Mind is chaos. Mind is chatterbox. It doesn't keep quiet even in sleep.
What is Meditation?
Meditation is witnessing of thoughts. When you witness your thoughts then there are gaps between thoughts. That is where meditation happens. These gaps are few milliseconds of no-mind. If you keep meditating for years then one fine day one of the gap will become permanent and you will enter samadhi - permanent state of no-mind.
How to do meditation ?
Morning time is best for meditation. Mind is naturally silent in the morning. Wake up before sunrise and find quiet place sit comfortably and closing your eye, you can start witnessing your breath first then nature sounds and lastly witness your thoughts.
Start as small as 10 minutes in the morning and then increase it every 15 days by 4 minutes."
Does enlightenment happen to an individual?,"Enlightenment happens to nobody.

"How can I understand Atma, Rebirth and Mukti in scientific terms? Being a student of science, it is too abstract and hard for me to digest.","Rebirth:-
Rebirth/reincarnation is reality. God can not be proved , but we have many proofs of reincarnation according to surveys conducted by many.
Now quantum physics also agrees with the theory given behind reincarnation.
Scientifically, mind is vibrations. Mind is whole life's accumulated desires, his whole life's accumulated memories, his whole life's karmas.
When a person dies, the body disappears, the material part disappears, but the immaterial part, the mind part, pure energy. That vibration is released, broadcast. Now, wherever a right womb is ready for this vibe, it will enter into the womb.
The universe is an expansion of energy , and life is crystallization of the energy. Nothing is created or destroyed in this universe everything just changes form.
Moksha/Enlightenment/Nirvana :—
As already mentioned :
Mind is whole life's accumulated desires, his whole life's accumulated memories, his whole life's karmas, desires and ambitions.
Enlightenment/moksha is cessation of mind before death. Mind dies as the brain dies with death of physical body.
Moksha is suicide by the ego ( the very nature of achieving).
One who attains Nirvana/Samadhi/moksha actually transcends the mind. In a way one who attains enlightenment he attains the state of no-mind , Shunya."
"Is the understanding of a joke, meditation?","This question only natural meditator can conceive and ask. Such a beautiful question on Quora is very rare.
While Understanding joke there is a gap created between perception and conclusion of the joke , thus that gap is where no-mind happens. Meditation is the state of no-mind. That is why we are relaxed after the joke.
The answer to your question - YES , understanding of the joke is a meditation."
Why did Osho say that Vivekananda had no knowledge about dharma? Was Osho greater than Vivekanand?,"Osho said Ramakrishna was enlightened but Vivekananda was not enlightened. Vivekananda was great intellectual. Being enlightened and being intellectual are two diametrically different aspects.
If you remain stuck to religion , you are religious not enlightened, if you remain stuck to God , you are God-realized not enlightened.
Enlightened means transcending mind, religion and God also."
Do enlightened people give off a different vibe?,"Mind is vibrations. Enlightened people live with no-mind. Enlightened people don't send off vibes at all. In fact presence of enlightened being is like whirlpool or black hole, his presence seems to pull all negativity around and everybody is left with love, gratitude, forgiveness and compassion.
Silence is the virtue of the enlightened being. Enlightened being always remains neural ( non-duality) and full of emptiness.
Presence of enlightened being can only be felt , it is beyond the words, language and concepts."
What is real enlightenment because some feel that what is written here on Quora does not appear to be enlightenment?,"Your question has the answer in itself. Enlightenment is unspeakable. The world of words, concepts and beliefs can't explain the world of silence.
The truth you will find is nowhere written and never could be uttered.
Though you can find details in Adhayatma Upanishad , Sarvsar Upanishad, Vedanta or Pitanjali yoga sutra.
But what I am about to say will throw cold water on everything you read about enlightenment.
Whatsoever you read about enlightenment is going to serve no purpose.
Because if you can understand all these details then either you are already enlightened or you are standing at the door of enlightenment and you just need a feather push.
Enlightenment is other worldly. No words of this world can express enlightenment to potentially enlightened person and one who has already reached doesn't need the details.

Enlightenment is experience of nothingness."
"How can I smell awful smells such as my breath, but everyone I ask says they smell nothing? It causes me so much anxiety.",There is something wrong with you lever or digest system.
What is the real wisdom of life?,"Wisdom is your ability to respond according to the situation. Wisdom is what you learn from experience, your first hand experience. Knowledge is what you learn from books and others.
Wisdom helps you to take different decision on the recurring situation, because what held true yesterday may not hold true today. Wisdom is your relationship with now."
What is the importance of the wisdom of a life situation?,"Wisdom is knowing the truth on your own. Wisdom is what you learn from experience, your first hand experience. Knowledge is what you learn from books and others. Wisdom has nothing to do with knowledge.
Life situations require Intelligence. Intelligence helps you to take different decision on the same situation at different time, because what held true yesterday may not hold true today.
Wisdom gives intuitive support to your intelligence."
Is possible to read lost books or destroyed books through meditation?,"Whatsoever written in the lost or destroyed book can be experienced by experiencing the ultimate bliss of enlightenment.
One who comes to know his truth doesn't need books to know the truth of existence.
Eternal truth of one's being renders all the books and knowledge of this world useless and irrelevant.
One who transcends mind, religion and God also doesn't need to read anything. He just lives out his being."
Can trees feel their existence?,"Anything that grows by itself has brain and heart but our modern science is not advenced enough to decode the nervous system of the plants or trees. Plants do have brain and heart also that is why they can sense the danger. Modern science can detect feelings of the trees. If you just pass by a tree with an axe, the tree will be frightened.
The shape and working of the heart and brain of the plants or trees doesn't match what our science knows as heart and brain. Trees are in their primitive stage. Someday when they will evolve like animals and humans they will walk and talk and run also."
What is the easiest way to get moksha?,"This question is coming out of mind and ego.
Mind hates complexity and arduous tasks.
Ego loves ambitions as high as moksha.
Now this is double trouble because moksha means cessation of ego and mind.
Neither you can make moksha desire nor you can reach there with mind.
Your question should be :-
Who am I?
Or
What is life?
Or
What is God?
You seem too young to search for truth of yourself.
Eat, sleep be merry."
Science says that reincarnation is not possible. Why do millions of people experience it?,"Rebirth/reincarnation is reality. God can not be proved , but we have many proofs of reincarnation according to surveys conducted by many.

Is status a barrier to spirituality?,"Not really, if one doesn't identify himself with status. If one becomes purely status then status is blockage not barrier.
Status is superficial abode for ego, because it works as catalyst to concretize ego."
Does having fish oil or fish collagen supplements decrease your spiritual vibrations?,"Since you have asked the question the answer is 'yes'. Fish oil or collagen is affecting your consciousnesconscious that is why you have asked this question.
If you are following path of tantra then neither non-veg nor alcohol affects spiritual journey. Tantra takes you as you are.
Fish oil is prescribed for good cholesterol HDL . You can substitute almonds."
Why do many millionaires have oversized egos?,"One who explores meaning of his being outside like big house, bank balance, stock value at wallstreet, 47th Mercedes etc. is bound to have Oversized EGO otherwise he will fail miserably.
Ambition and desires are two motivating factors for millionaires to be millionaire. They are always in their head doing calculations. If they leave tip on restaurant's table they do it out of ego and they miserably believe it to be act of generosity.
One thing you will notice in lives of all those millionaires- they don't have love and compassion in their life so they start accumulating materialistic things.
Ego helps them to be shrewd and heartless and that is what business about.
Next time, go and try to find how they spend their weekend - shopping, watching movie or long drive. Everything they do, they do just to try to zip away from their lives.
Now ego helps them to be successful and success is catalyst to ego. They go hand in hand."
What is the highest stage of enlightenment?,"There is NO low or high of enlightenment. Either one is enlightened or potentially enlightened.
There is no degree of enlightenment. It is like either you have reached home or you are outside your home, it is not like my one leg has reached home and soon rest of my body will be at home.
Enlightenment happens like sudden clash of thunder and there is no returning."
Why is appreciating someone so difficult? Is it ego? Competition? Jealousy? What else?,"Ego is resultant product of multiplication of greed, ambition, jealousy, hatred everything that is impermanent in you.
And all these emotions are result of desires. Desire is form of sexual energy. Sexual energy is lifeblood in us.
Desire to dominate and reproduce is our animal instinct."
Is cultivating a good heart the essence of spiritual practice? Why?,"I suppose by- 'cultivating a good heart' you mean having positive emotions like forgiveness, gratitude and compassion.
Yes, it is essence of any spiritual practice.
Why?
Because in these emotions no one can be nagative. Ego melts away and one becomes innocent in these emotions. All worries are because of the emotions like anger, hatred, jealousy and guilt and cause of these emotions is ego.
Watch the small kid - his all negative emotions are also beautiful because of his innocence.
You become a child at heart."
How do I open my 3rd eye? What workable process can I employ to do this?,"Here is my answer to similar question:-
Swami Jai Deep's post in Vigyan Bhairav Tantra"
Is Gautama Buddha the greatest philosopher of all time in the whole world?,"Gautama Buddha was scientist of Einstein's calibre. He gave new path(negation) to self-realisation without hypothesis of God and soul.
Gautama Buddha gave clear reasons for reincarnation. What Gautama Buddha said about universe 2500 years ago is verified by modern quantum physics now.
Gautama Buddha's teachings are scientific not philosophical.
Gautama Buddha was scientist not philosopher."
"How do you awaken your spiritual powers and third eye (meditation, etc.)?","Here is my answer to the similar question :-

How can we measure the levels of frustration?,"Frustration check :-
Joke therapy - frustration"
Do some people never recover from the dark night of the soul?,"Nobody remains stuck in ‘the dark night of the soul'. You will certainly recover.
Dark night of soul is actually dark night of ego. Your soul wants to run a marathon and your ego is cribbing like a kid at candy shop.Your soul can't go alone so your soul is dragging your ego, trying to convince your ego, hey let's run there is a beautiful dawn. It is a painful process. Because your ego is dying or backbone of your ego is being broken (one of most Traumatic experience), this situation gives you death like experience (but don't worry you won't die) you will have complex PTSD ATTACKS.
SOLUTION:- MEDITATE BY WITNESSING. Go for morning walks. Have heathy diet. Do have good multivitamins, vitamin D and vitamin c. Minimize alcohol. Enjoy your hobbies. Try to be with family. Watch movies.Or you can contact good therapist , he can heal you in few sitting. There are beautiful and comprehensive videos from Christina Lopes on youtube (must watch).
Any enlightened master can heal you in few seconds with one touch.
There are two ways for instant cure by enlightened master :-
Shaktipat - transfer of cosmic energy by physical touch.
Grace - remotely cosmic energy transfer.
Tantra explanation of the ' dark night of the soul' :-
Swami Jai Deep's answer to How do you get through the Dark Night of the Soul? How long does it usually last?"
"If human beings become immortal, will we begin to perceive time differently?","We Indians/Bhartiye will behave same way and perceive time exactly the same way we treat time at present .
Because we already believe that we are immortals. That is why we believe in soul and reincarnation.
We are never genuinely in hurry. We put tasks off for tomorrow usually.
We have special IST (that means 3 hrs late minimum).
Don't worry nothing will change in India. It's time to sleep because I have to meet some immortals tomorrow morning at 9 am , so I have to get ready by 12pm.
Gudnight."
"Is ego (identity) formed right after birth, or does it develop gradually?","The sense of me and mine starts to form from age 4 and actual ego starts to form at age 7. Till 7 everyone is more or less innocent.
After 7 ego starts shaping every moment and kind of develops into a character. Ego will have traits based on DNA and also the upbringing, religion and all that runs in the family and society.
Ego is very complex phenomena and lifeblood for the existence of any human."
"Humanity wise, where is the world headed? Enlightenment or the end of humanity and society as we know it?","There is no change. Everything is getting worst.
Corona virus is affecting collective unconsciousness (not collective consciousness) , now people are becoming more vulnerable and isolated.
Humans have not learnt any lesson from pandemic like Corona Virus.People are still living unconsciously. There is fear of death underneath conscious mind in subconscious mind. Fear of death has not liberated people to live courageously. They are trying to find every reason to forget the seriousness of pandemic.people have grown impatient in last few months.
Ego of people has not changed a bit. Ego is like water it takes lowest route to reach its destination. Man will remain blind regardless what happens to him.
Nothing is going to change until we stop living unconsciously."
"What are chakras, and how do I incorporate them into meditation?","Here is my answer to similar question.
Swami Jai Deep's answer to How do I evoke the chakras? I know it is done by meditation, but what are the steps to be followed to evoke my internal chakra to know who I am?
I hope it will help."
Can Kundalini heal diseases and sickness? I'm just curious. I'm a bit wary of it.,"Kundalini awakening cures most the body organs. Diseases like weak eyesight, gallbladder or kidney stones, hypertension,brain disorder , mood swings, minor cancer.
Kundalini awakening is very useful in curing Complex - PTSD (Post Taurmatic Stress ) and Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD).
Few other diseases are known to be cured by Kundalini awakening :-
Alzheimer's Disease.
Dementias
Epilepsy and Other Seizure Disorders
Parkinson's and Other Movement Disorders.
While these are the list of diseases known to be cured by Kundalini awakening or Kundalini direct energy transfer via SHAKTIPAT by enlightened master.
There is a flipside to Kundalini awakening. If the energy is stuck somewhere in chakras then there can extreme case of mental illness , complusive suicide and compulsive behaviour disorder.
Kundalini awakening is 80% safe and 20% you can rely on expert."
Is ignorance bliss?,"Not-knowing is true bliss. We all pretend to be know-it-all. Even on Quora you will see , the moment you ask question , there will be so many answers not making any sense.
Everybody turns to expert the moment you ask question and he tries to defend his answer with crazy arguments and silly logic. Everybody loves to be knower to look intelligent.
The state of not-knowing (innocent ignorance) is highest intelligence.You live in present moment if you are in state of not-knowing. There is no baggage of previous knowledge. Your response changes according to present moment. What held true yesterday might not hold true today - not-knowing makes you live here and now."
Did coronavirus bring spiritual awakening throughout the world?,"Danger of Corona virus is affecting collective unconsciousness (not collective consciousness) ,now people are becoming more vulnerable and isolated.
Humans have not learnt any lesson from pandemic like Corona Virus.People are still living unconsciously. There is fear of death underneath conscious mind in subconscious mind. Fear of death has not liberated people to live courageously. They are trying to find every reason to forget the seriousness of pandemic.
There is a story of Buddha and Devdutt (Buddha's cousin). Devdutt was jealous of Buddha and he arranged a mad elephant to kill Buddha.When Buddha came , he stuffed the mad elephant with lot of alcohol to make sure he crushes Buddha without fail. When mad elephant faced Buddha , elephant just bowed down in the feet of Buddha.
Devdutt was surprised and frustrated but he concluded elephant was not mad and alcohol given to him was not enough then he started to explore new ways to kill Buddha.
Ego is like water it takes lowest route to reach its destination. Man will remain blind regardless what happens to him.
Nothing is going to change until we stop living unconsciously."
What is the approximate time period for reincarnation of a soul? Why can't the reincarnation happen in same family and why does the atheist completely disbelief reincarnation although there were innumerable evidences including those of shanti Devi's?,"Rebirth/reincarnation is reality. God can not be proved but we have many proofs of reincarnation according to surveys conducted by many.
Now quantum physics also agrees with theory given for reincarnation.
Scientifically, mind is vibrations. Mind is whole life's accumulated desires, his whole life's accumulated memories, his whole life's karmas.
When a person dies, the body disappears, the material part disappears, but the immaterial part, the mind part, pure energy. That vibration is released, broadcast. Now, wherever a right womb is ready for this vibe, it will enter into the womb.
Human can reborn infinite times till he attains Nirvana/moksha and he will reborn as human only not anything else. Surprisingly he will born around the previous birth place and maybe family, if the soul finds the suitable womb.
Soul is shocked on death of the body and it remains there for 4 days and maximum upto 13 days. Soul can keep roaming for years till it finds suitable womb to enter.
In case of sudden death soul may remain for longer period. In case of suicide or natural death soul remains around the body for 4 days , then it continues with its new journey."
Why does ego never accept the truth?,"Ego always stands by the truth. Ego stands by what seems truth to it. Ego is subtle.
Ego's situation is same as the fox's situation in Aesop's Fables: Fox and grapes.
Ego disparages what it cannot achieve or have."
How do you permanently delete your mind?,"Mind can't be erased. Mind escapes after death also and converted into other energy form. According to religious beliefs mind is released on death and enters new womb.
Scientifically, mind is vibrations - a form of energy which is released on death and converted into other form of energy. As science has proved - nothing is destroyed , everything changes form.
The universe is expansion of energy and life is crystallization of this energy. Everything we see , all are manifestations of the same energy in infinite forms and ways.

But only in samadhi(enlightenment) brain is formatted and mind is rewritten/reinstalled like installing new operating system. It is like updating your smartphone with fully featured latest Android O/S (it's Android 10).
Now latest installation will utilise all available features of your brain like third eye, crown chakra and all other areas of brain, making you complete human or superhuman."
Is it true that the soul of someone who died stays in their home until the 13th day after their death?,"Soul is shocked on death of the body and it remains there for 4 days and maximum upto 13 days. Soul can keep roaming for years till it finds suitable womb to enter.
In case of sudden death soul may remain for longer period. In case of suicide or natural death soul remains around the body for 4 days , then it finds new womb to enter.
What is soul?
Soul is eternal seed covered by the subtle body called sukshma Sharir. Sukshma sharir is a shell around soul which is made up of desires, lust and ambitions.
For worldly people sukshma Sharir (subtle body) is transferred to new womb. But for one who attains Nirvana , sukshma sharir vanishes and soul returns to eternal source."
What is the meaning of money for a self-realized or enlightened person?,"Money is utilitarian and it is treated as essential and enlightened being never gets used by money.
He knows the limits of money and its usage."
How does one attain samadhi? How can you explain it?,"There are many beautiful answers to this question. In fact you can find many websites/books on it.
Helen Balvatsky has done great job in writing about samadhi (enlightenment) in Secret Doctrine.Samadhi | Theosophy World
You can find details in Adhayatma Upanishad , Sarvsar Upanishad, Vedanta or Pitanjali yoga sutra.
What I am about to say will throw cold water on everything you know about samadhi. Whatsoever you read about samadhi is going to serve no purpose.
Because if you can understand all these details then either you are already enlightened or you are standing at the door of enlightenment and you just need a feather push.
Even one who already had satori can't comprehend all that is said about stages of enlightenment/samadhi.
Enlightenment/samadhi is other worldly. No words of this world can express enlightenment to potentially enlightened person and one who has already reached doesn't need the details. In fact there are no stages of enlightenment. Either you are enlightened or you are not.
You can't make enlightenment/Samadhi a goal or ambition. Whatsoever becomes desire or ambition is worldly and enlightenment/samadhi is other worldly.
What works in material world doesn't work in spiritual world."
What is the reason we concentrate on breathing in Vipassana?,"Vipassana is one of the 112 methods of meditation mentioned in Vigyan Bhairav Tantra by Lord Shiva.
All meditations are about becoming witness. Witnessing is the key and you can choose anything active/flowing as subject of witnessing.
Like you can choose rising sun, flowing river, sound of nature or the closest one your breath. You become witness of your breathing.
All meditations lead you to self-realisation."
How many times can a human take rebirths?,"Human can reborn infinite times till he attain Nirvana/moksha and he will reborn as human only not anything else.
Human can't reborn as any other form like animals or trees."
"How do I know if I have some telepathic ability, as well as what is the evidence of it? If I do, how do I use and train it?","If you had telepathic ability, you wouldn't have come on Quora to ask."
"How long does spiritual awakening take, especially the introspection phase?","There are many beautiful answers to this question. In fact you can find many websites/books on it.

There is a parable about Buddha. When Buddha attained enlightenment. He didn't come out of it for seven days. All the gods gathered at his feet and requested Buddha not to remain silent. They said , “ So many people for lifetimes wait for someone to become a Buddha and deliver the message after coming back from samadhi, to speak and tell what he has known. Please speak.”
But Buddha said, “ There is no one left here to speak , there is no desire left to speak. Moreover what I have witnessed- it is hard for me to believe that it can be spoken and where is the chance of listeners understanding it?”
When Gods didnt agree, Buddha said, “I will speak; but these things that I may say to somebody , I myself would not have understood had someone else told me before my own realisation. So how would anybody else understand? Through my experience of Samadhi I have come to one more conclusion , that those who will be able to understand what I have to say can also reach without me; and those who would not be able to understand what I have to say- there is no sense in racking one's brain in front of them.”
Enlightenment is experience of nothingness."
How will the space-time evolve as we go into samadhi and as we come out of it?,"Mind is left at doorstep before entering Samadhi. During Samadhi , the objects of the experiences are not seperate from experiencer. Experiencer is dissolved as his ego evaporates. In Samadhi there is no space-time as there is no experiencer.
But these intense experiences of the seeker who has come out of Samadhi are inferred through recollections of the mind. Mind works like a camera recollecting everything happening in Samadhi from door.
After coming out of Samadhi one is not able to speak for days or months.
There is a parable about Buddha. When Buddha attained samadhi. He didn't come out of it for seven days. All the devatas (Gods) gathered at his feet and requested Buddha not to remain silent. They said , “ So many people for lifetimes wait for someone to become a Buddha and deliver the message after coming back from samadhi, to speak and tell what he has known. Please speak.”
But Buddha said, “ There is no one left here to speak , there is no desire left to speak. Moreover what I have witnessed- it is hard for me to believe that it can be spoken and where is the chance of listeners understanding it?”
When Gods didnt agree, Buddha said, “I will speak; but these things that I may say to somebody , I myself would not have understood had someone else told me before my own realisation. So how would anybody else understand? Through my experience of Samadhi I have come to one more conclusion , that those who will be able to understand what I have to say can also reach without me; and those who would not be able to understand what I have to say- there is no sense in racking one's brain in front of them.”
Samadhi is experience of nothingness."
What exactly do you need to do to open your fire chakra?,"Fire chakra is also called Manipura Chakra. It is third chakra out of seven. Fire chakra is related to ego. Ego has basis as possessiveness, hatred , jealousy and greed. Fire chakra is loaded with negative emotions.
To activate fire chakra you will have to relax muladhar(root) chakra. Root chakra can be relaxed if you treat sex as you basic virtue. Sex has always been treated as taboo. Once you be aware of sex, Muladhar chakra will be relaxed.
Second you have to get over fear of death. Fear of death is related to Swadhisthan Chakra (Hara chakra). Look at it this way - death is just another journey.
Fire (Manipura) chakra is loaded with negative emotions and that is why your stomach becomes upset when you are emotionally disturbed; you suddenly feel nausea. You feel like vomiting and vomiting helps to relax. Negative emotions anger,hatred and jealousy are repressed that is why your fire chakra is overloaded.
You have to remain aware of these emotions and don't become unconscious in gust of these emotions.You can practice positive emotions like forgiveness, compassion and letting go.
Ego will hold you harder and harder as you practice positive emotions. But sooner or later you will succeed."
Has anyone ever experienced Nirvana after Buddha?,Yes I have experienced Nirvana and there are many other I know of. Some are in America and some in Europe.
Why do people often associate feelings and emotions with the heart when they actually come from the brain?,"The greatest enlightened being - Pitanjali has detailed in Pitanjali yoga sutras about heart chakra. Heart chakra is mind of heart.
We have brain/mind to control our body likewise heart has its own mind and wisdom. Some people call it soul. Wisdom/mind of heart is called soul.
In old times people used to live by heart. People were more intuitive and more truthful. If you go to some aboriginals you will find the simplicity and joy in their life because they live by heart. It doesn't mean that they don't use mind. They use mind more efficiently for day to day life.
Mind is logical and heart is emotional."
"Is there something wrong with me if I stopped caring what happens to people? Before if someone I knew died, I would've cried, but now I don't care at all.I don't feel the sadness and I don't feel guilty.I also stopped caring myself, if i died so wat?","Here is my answer to similar question. I hope it will help you.
Swami Jai Deep's answer to Practicing meditation for almost 7-8 years, Recently whenever I meditate I feel like I'm about to die, all my perception of time physical body and gravity looses, such a weird and SCARY feeling, what should I do now should I stop meditating? HELP"
Is a guru really needed for enlightenment?,"""The day I became enlightened"" simply means the day I realized that there is nothing to achieve, there is nowhere to go.
There are many beautiful answers to this question. In fact you can find many websites/books on it.
You can find details in Adhayatma Upanishad , Sarvsar Upanishad, Vedanta or Pitanjali yoga sutra.
But what I am about to say will throw cold water on everything you read about enlightenment.
Whatsoever you read about enlightenment is not going to serve any purpose.
Because if you can understand all these details then either you are already enlightened or you are standing at the door of enlightenment and you just need a feather push.
Enlightenment is other worldly. No words of this world can express enlightenment to potentially enlightened person and one who has already reached doesn't need the details.
You can't make enlightenment a goal or destination. Whatsoever becomes desire is worldly and enlightenment is other worldly.
No guru is needed because real master is hard to find. People with borrowed knowledge pretend exceptionally well that you will be deceived easily."
"If people get enlightened, will they enjoy the world or not?","Enlightened being continues to enjoy what he used to enjoy. Enlightened being enjoys everything as a witness.
Now he knows the meaning of leela. Hindus call this life leela and this world maya. Enlightened being knows the meaning of both words in true sense and nature of them."
Is it possible that by doing daily meditation we can improve our senses?,"Meditation makes you more aware of your senses and surroundings. If you meditate by witnessing your senses, the sensitivity of your senses will improve and resultantly your focus will also improve."
"Why didn't the mainstream media or an Indian intellectual snob raise their voices against the movie ""Wild Wild Country"", which degrades the most learned man of his time, Bhagwan Osho?","If you love Osho then this question is natural. But if you love his teachings then this question puts you into same category of people who made and enjoyed “Wild Wild country.”
His whole work is for individuals. He always maintained that revolution can happen to individuals only not to the crowd.
If you start understanding him then the question you have asked will have no meaning.
Don't bother about others, just be a little selfish. Work on yourself. Enlightenment is the only freedom.
Now the fact : Main stream media, politicians, priests all exploit your state of unconsciousness and if you are awakened then they will be out of business or power."
What are the 7 stages of enlightenment?,"There are many beautiful answers to this question. In fact you can find many websites/books on it.
Helen Balvatsky has done great job in writing about samadhi (enlightenment) in secret doctrine.
Samadhi | Theosophy World
You can find details in Adhayatma Upanishad , Sarvsar Upanishad, Vedanta or Pitanjali yoga sutra.
But what I am about to say will throw cold water on everything you read about enlightenment/samadhi.
Whatsoever you read about enlightenment is not going to serve any purpose.
Because if you can understand all these details then either you are already enlightened or you are standing at the door of enlightenment and you just need a feather push.
Even one who already had satori can't comprehend all that is said about stages of enlightenment/samadhi.
Enlightenment is other worldly. No words of this world can express enlightenment to potentially enlightened person and one who has already reached doesn't need the details.
In fact there are no stages of enlightenment. Either you are enlightened or you are not.
You can't make enlightenment a goal or destination. Whatsoever becomes desire is worldly and enlightenment is other worldly."
"How can I keep faith and patience during spiritual awakening? I feel that I’m making progress but when roller coaster of emotions and doubts kick in, I feel I’m back to square one and feel hopeless.","Whatsoever becomes your desire it becomes worldly. You can not make enlightenment your desire. Enlightenment is of other world which can't be object of desire.
No matter how an enlightened person/ master try to explain steps to enlightenment, it can't be contained in words and everybody’s journey to enlightenment is unique. No two persons will reach enlightenment by the same door.
But one thing is common to realisation of all.
You will have to leave all desires including the desire to be desireless. All other things are optional but desirelessness is must.
It sounds confusing but that is why enlightenment is rare."
Can I learn any skills in my astral projection?,"Astral projection should not be tried without master. If you come accross enlightened master you will feel the peace and confidence to try siddhis.
Astral projection is most advanced stage of out of body experience (OBE). I know it because I had few OBEs. Recently I had OBE on 21st Jun and it left me very weak for 3 days. OBE causes damage to CNS (CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM).
I advise you to take this matter seriously because getting out of body might be easy but getting back to body may not be cakewalk.
If you are serious about astral travel then be ready to spend at least 4–6 years. It takes time and patience."
What is the meaning of “self-realization”?,"From the time we are born we keep accumulating conditionings in form of desires, lust, etiquettes, morals, goals, ideologies and religion.
Everybody is born with questions and all our lives we keep finding answers to irrelevant questions and in form of material things and relations.
You can see soneone with 100s of cars or someone with 100's watches. You might come accross someone who is getting married 9th times. Moreover you will see someone had 6th baby girl in desire of boy.
Everything we do is of course worldly. But there are few who get fade up with all this chasing of material things and they ask question - Who am I?
You are not your ego,You are not your desires, you are not your possessions, you are not even family. Whatsoever you think true is maya.
Real you is the way you came to this world - tabula rasa - clean slate.
When you realise your true self that is called self-realisation."
What is the difference between simple meditation and advanced meditation?,"There is no such thing as advanced or simple meditation
Let's get straight to the point - there is only One way to meditate.
By becoming witness.
Now you can practice witnessing in three ways :-
By witnessing your activities (walking,talking,eating) and be aware of natural needs of the BODY like hunger, thirst,lust (specially). Live here and now.
By witnessing your emotions, always be aware of your emotions like anger,hatred,fear, jealousy and choose positive emotions like gratitude, compassion, forgiveness.Transform your poisons into nectar.
By witnessing your thoughts - you meditate by witnessing your thoughts. There are gaps between thoughts. That is where meditation happens. If you meditate for years then one fine day one of the gap will become permanent and you will enter state of no-mind. This is called Samadhi. Permanent transcendence of mind.
In the state of no-mind you will be able to actually feel your chakras. Through mind, it's all mind games.Meditate by witnessing.
Why does it work?
When you hit your mind 10000 times from all available directions (body,heart,mind) with positive emotions and thoughts and you live here and now. One day mind surrenders and you attain state of no-mind - Samadhi - ultimate bliss -enlightenment."
"How do I evoke the chakras? I know it is done by meditation, but what are the steps to be followed to evoke my internal chakra to know who I am?","Let's get straight to the point - there is only One way to activate chakras.
By transcending mind and becoming witness.
There are three ways you can practice witnessing :-
By witnessing your activities(walking,talking,eating) and be aware of natural needs of the BODY like hunger, thirst,lust (specially). Live here and now.

Why does it work?
When you hit your mind 10000 times with positive emotions and thoughts and you live in now. One day mind surrenders and you attain state of no-mind - the key to mysteries of this existence."
How are insecurity and ego connected?,"Fear of unknown (insecurities) shakes the ego so much that it affects your CNS. Ego longs for security.
All you do in your life just for emotional or financial security. Ironically death makes everybody secure indiscriminately. Only Death is true communist.
Good education gives you good job hence a financial security. Good job gives you nice life partner hence emotional security.
People are always obsessed by life insurance, bank balance, big house , gold in locker even parents grow their children as an asset so that they are taken care of.
Human ego lives out of fear only. One who transcends ego knows true meaning of life."
Why does spiritual enlightenment seem so far off and unattainable? How can I bring myself closer to reaching it?,"Whatsoever becomes your desire it becomes worldly. You can not make enlightenment your desire. Enlightenment is of other world which can't be addressed or expressed in the language of this world.
No matter how an enlightened person try to describe enlightenment, words won't be able to contain it. The language one knows is not enough because words can't express experience of other world.
It is like hearing from eyes and seeing through nose.
You will have to leave all desires including the desire to be desireless.
It sounds contradictory but that is why it is rare."
Which of Madame Blavatsky's books is the most accessible introduction to Theosophy?,The Secret Doctrine by Blavatsky
Do enlightened people get hurt by sharp criticism?,"Nobody gets hurt by sharp criticism. Ego gets hurt not the person. Enlightened people remain aware when ego gets in action. It is their ability to see ego at work makes them invulnerable.
That is the only difference between awakened and potentially awakened people."
"When some Buddhist monks at the monastery looked at me just for a second, I started to cry or experience other emotional states very intensively. How do they do this? Why does it happen? How does it work?","Enlightened people/monks are full of emptiness. Your anxiety, tension, anger, jealousy and hatred starts to be soaked by their presence and all you are left with love and compassion.
Your forgotten nature surfaces and you feel the divine love of God.
This experience can't be defined in words. It can be experienced only.
One who experiences it can never forget it."
How does meditation help in generating ideas?,"First thing first!
What is mind?
The mind is a constant traffic: thoughts are moving, desires are moving, memories are moving, ambitions are moving – it is a constant traffic! Day in, day out. Even when you are asleep the mind is functioning, it is dreaming. It is still thinking; it is still in worries and anxieties. It is preparing for the next day; an underground preparation is going on. Mind is all about random thoughts.
What is meditation?
Meditation is choiceless choice. Meditation is non-doing. You just watch thoughts moving as an observer.
How does meditation help generating ideas?
When you meditate then there are gaps between thoughts. These gaps are moments of no-mind.When you knowingly touch the state of no-mind for few seconds or milliseconds, your mind and body relaxes. Relaxed mind manages thoughts well and thoughts become more organized , this enhances your creativity ; hence you are able to generate unlimited ideas.
Meditation makes you more efficient in what you love to do."
What exactly do we have to do in meditation?,"Don't make any goal of meditation. If you make a goal of meditation , then your ego will make it an ambition and you will struggle meditating , you will be frustrated.
Meditation is non-doing. Doing is a way of moving out. Non-doing is a way of moving in to the centre of your being.
The trick to meditate is to become observer of mind.Meditation starts by being separate from the mind, by being a witness of mind. e.g. When you look at mirror , you will only see your face if there is a distance between your face and mirror, if mirror is too close to your face you won't be able to see your face. Likewise when you become observer/witness of mind then a gap is created between mind and witness/observer/watcher.
Watching is the key of meditation. Watch your mind. Don’t do anything – no repetition of mantra, no repetition of the name of god- As you watch, slowly mind becomes empty of thoughts; but you are not falling asleep, you are becoming more alert, more aware.
While witnessing there will be gaps between any two thoughts and this is where meditation happens. As you keep meditating these gaps will become larger and larger and one fine day one of the gap will become permanent - the state of no-mind.This is called Samadhi- pure consciousness.
Permanent cessation of mind."
"Is it okay to have some thoughts running in the ""background"" while meditating?","The very word you used “background” tells that you are aware of the thoughts. You are being a witness to the thoughts and that is meditation is all about.
No matter what thoughts are but be witness to the thoughts. There are gaps between thoughts and that is where meditation happens. That is where the no-mind is. As you keep meditating for months or years these gaps will become longer and longer and one fine day one of the gap will become permanent - that is called state of no-mind.
The state of no-mind is called samadhi. The ultimate bliss."
What if there were no such thing as twin flames at all? Would that really be so bad?,"Twin flames concept is real but this happens one in a million. Twin flames concept is overused and commercialized like matrimonial and dating sites. Bases of dating and twin flames is deep desire to be loved and be with someone you are attached to.
Twin flames consultants talk of twin flames between opposite sex only not between same sex.
To understand it better let's dig deeper into Tantra.
Tantra says you can make anybody your twin flame if you can match your Kundalini Chakras with your partner.
Body has energy centers in etheric body and if that centers match with somebody then there happens instant connection.
This connection is also called soulmates.
To find your soulmate you will have to work on your etheric body which will activate wisdom of your soul and which will help you find your twin flame or soulmate."
How many soulmates or twin flames can someone have?,"One is free to do anything. Specially mind is totally free to imagine anything that is why mind is fantasy island.
You can have as many relations as you desire maybe out of 100 you will find your soulmate/twinflame.
When one can have many Gods and Godess. Then it is very natural to be free to have many soulmates/twinflames. Variety will keep you busy and maybe someday you will be bored of all this and you start searching God and meaning of life."
What should I look out for while learning self hypnosis?,"Self-hypnosis is also called autohypnosis.
It can be done by following steps :-
Step 1 : Set alarm of 10 minutes and repeat to yourself 3 times that within 10 minutes , when the alarm goes off , I will come back from deep hypnotic sleep.
Step 2 : Look at some shiny light and go on repeating inside , “ My eyes are becoming heavier and heavier and I am falling into sleep. I can't keep my eyes open anymore; I am trying my best,but it is impossible” - it takes exactly 3 minutes.
Note : Try your best to keep your eyes open so that they become heavier and heavier.
Step 3 : Now you are in autohypnosis , you can easily put any SUGGESTION like I have left smoking. Put only one suggestion at a time.
And when the alarm will ring you will be back from deep hypnotic sleep.
Whatsoever you put in third step will become part of your subconscious mind.
PS : You can also use cellphone playback for autosuggestion."
Many people keep writing about Enlightenment. But when you read those you realise that these people some of whom claim to have got enlightened have not even an iota of understanding of what Enlightenment is. Can someone tell what enlightenment is?,"There are beautiful answers theoretically. But no one can express something beyond what our ordinary words can explain. Let me try to explain how to be awakened /enlightened? So that you can taste it.
Human mind is most complex on this earth and maybe in this universe. That is the reason we have progressed exponentially. Everything we have is because of our excellent brain. Mind’s ability to work in patterns and perceptions makes it utilitarian but stubborn also.
It is not easy to break its habits (patterns) because brain(mind is operating system) is hardwired as master of our being by the nature. Enlightenment is all about making mind slave of your being. The process of enlightenment is unnatural that is why it is destructive and painful.
“Enlightenment is a destructive process. It has nothing to do with becoming better or being happier. Enlightenment is the crumbling away of untruth. It's seeing through the facade of pretence. It's the complete eradication of everything we imagined to be true.” - Adyashanti
Enlightenment is like major upgrade** to Operating system (mind) of brain.
Q. What is enlightenment exactly?
There are three states of mind - waking, dreaming and sleeping. Enlightenment is living in fourth - Turiya - pure consciousness.
Q. How can one live in Turiya (fourth)?
You can train your mind to be passive by negativa (Buddha's way) and you train your consciousness to be active by meditation (meditate by witnessing).
Step 1 : Hit your mind 10000 times and in 10000 ways by negativa (message of egolessness).
Step 2 : Meditate by witnessing all your actions, emotions and thoughts.
You will reach home definitely.

**It is not major upgrade but downgrade in terms of complexity or you can say altogether new Operating System."
Can you please describe the spiritual bliss that yogis reach through meditation? How do we differentiate it from hallucinations?,"There are six layers( layers are listed at end of the answer) of ego (personality) and when we meditate for many years the layers are peeled like peeling an onion.
If you have entered death layer (hallucinations) of ego and your ego is about to die , this is also called - “the dark night of the soul” - ( there are very informative videos by Christina Lopes on YouTube).
If you be aware and keep meditating then you will enter LIFE (new life) layer and your old ego will die and new birth will begin from LIFE layer, then there are two possibilities one you can become epicurous or Buddha there is one more layer to enlightenment that is BLISS , once you enter BLISS layer you become Buddha.
Both possibilities are beautiful.
Frederick S. Perls has listed six layers of ego in his book :- Ego, Hunger, and Aggression
Here are list of layers :-
Layer one : In this people live artificial life like if they go to funeral they cry with others but their tears mean nothing. They say Hello but to avoid people. This layer is called CHICKENSHIT.
Layer two : This layer is pure ego. It is like - I AM PRESIDENT OF AMERICA. I AM HUSBAND OF MISS UNIVERSE. People in this layer are bit better than layer one but dangerous because they become politicians, police officers etc.
This layer is called BULLSHIT.
Layer three: When something bad happens in layer two like death of loved one or divorce then people like poets, authors, musicians, lyricists or people good at heart fall to third layer. This layer is called CHAOS. Here people either become alcoholic or druggist or go back to layer two.
If one remains meditative and aware then he enters next layer.
Layer four: This is DEATH layer ,where you touch death experiences of yourself and your loved one.
If one remains aware in this layer by meditating then he or she enters LIFE phase.
To be frank, in this layer you need a MASTER who can give birth to your new ego otherwise you will move like zombie or you will revert to layer two.
Layer five : This layer is called LIFE.Your new ego has to take new form and new dimensions of loving and compassionate life.
You can become epicurous or Buddha, if you remain aware.
From here MASTER can't help you. You will be guided by your wisdom.
Layer SIX: This layer is called BLISS. If you come to this layer then you have possibility of becoming BUDDHA- full of pure love and awareness."
Does rebirth really happen?,"Rebirth/reincarnation is reality. God can not be proved but we have many proofs of reincarnation according to surveys conducted by many.
Now quantum physics also agrees with theory given behind reincarnation.
All enlightened people know that mind is vibrations. Mind is whole life's accumulated desires, his whole life's accumulated memories, his whole life's karmas.
When a person dies, the body disappears, the material part disappears, but the immaterial part, the mind part, pure energy. That vibration is released, broadcast. Now, wherever a right womb is ready for this vibe, it will enter into the womb.
Einstein’s greatest equation, E = mc(2) is proof that everything in this universe is form of energy and nothing is destroyed in this world everything just changes form."
"Osho said we are all enlightened, we have just forgotten. How can we remember that we are enlightened?","There are beautiful answers theoretically. No one has answered the second part of your question. Let me try:-

Which activities are like meditation and can be incorporated in one's life?,"You can make your life meditation. By being aware of everything you do. You remain mindful while talking,walking and eating.
One can maditate in one of three ways or all three :-
Karma yoga(body) :- you live here and now and remain mindful of your actions.
Bhakti yoga(heart) :- this is path of devotion. You meditate by praying or chanting mantra.
Dhyaan yoga(mind):- this is path of mind. You meditate by being aware of your thoughts.
You can live mindful life and your life will become meditation."
What is the spiritual significance of being an introvert?,"Introverts are naturally silent people. There are three path to self-realisation/awakening.
Karma yoga, Bhakti yoga and Dhyaan yoga.
All three lead to self-realisation.
Dhyaan yoga is specifically suited to introverts. Introverts will find easy to meditate.
If you see the idol of Buddha, you will see an introvert.
Dhyaan is shortest path to self-realisation. If you are introvert then that doesn't mean you are claimant of enlightenment. But it will help."
What is Baba Ramdev doing with billions he is making from his Patanjali brand? Is he a con man? Is he a holy cow?,Just look into his eyes.
How can a person block out all things to do with spirituality after unnecessary awakening?,"You can certainly go to some good therapist for Complex PTSD (Post Taurmatic stress Disorder) treatment. He can certainly help you out.
What I see you are leading a frustrated life and maybe this is not right time for awakening. If it has to happen it will after some months or years.
You do what's in your hand. Go and have treatment. It certainly helps."
"How do I find a purpose in life, work, and meditation?","You can find purpose in life by just being bit intelligent.
What is intelligence?
Your conscious response to now. Living here and now.
Here are steps to live meaningful life
Live here and now
Transform your posions (anger,greed, jealousy,hatred) into nectar (love, forgiveness and gratitude).
Always share positive things with people around you.
Always choose compassion over ego.
Once you practice these steps you will find your passion and your life will become meditation."
Do you experience OBE after practicing Shirshasana? Has it made you ecstatic or fearful?,"I have had few OBE. It was bit scary but I enjoyed it. The trouble came afterwards when it left me weak for few days. OBE taxes Central Nervous System badly.
But it is worth experiencing even at the cost of life.
Update: I have noticed OBE on 21st June morning. That was day of Amavasya( new moon) and sun eclipse."
"DELTA WAVES + water SOUND this guy Says that if we listen to this video in low sound we will get dreamless sleep, increase in empathy and intuition and we can go in deepest level of meditation here is link of that guy - PLz HELP THAT IS IT real?","I have experimented with binaural beat music - 4 hz , 5 hz and 6 hz. With 6hz one goes into lucid dreaming immediately. I had few out of body experiences ( OBE) first time with binaural beat music.
It works like magic.
The YouTube video you have mentioned in link has noticable breaks. Music is fine but because of breaks I think it needs improvement. And playing at 320 version will definitely work.
You can find many binaural beat on SOUNDCLOUD. Maybe Delta waves also."
What is the language of the discourses of Gautama Buddha?,Though Gautama Buddha was well versed in Sanskrit but he chose language of common man i.e. PALI. Everything he transmitted in PALI.
Why does meditation drain all energy in and make me tired whenever I meditate?,"If you are getting exhausted by meditating then you are simply concentrating or contemplating too hard. Meditation is neither concentrating nor contemplating.
In fact , you can't do meditation. Because meditation and doing has no relation. Meditation is all about non-doing. Meditation is all about witnessing your thoughts without any interference. It is like when the water gets muddy and you have to search your lost toy in water. You just sit and wait till water gets cleared and you can see you favourite toy. Then you go and get it.
You just sit and watch your thoughts and after sometime you will notice gaps between thoughts and if you keep meditating for years one day one of the gap will become permanent leaving you serene forever.
Meditation is a knack of doing nothing."
"What is your opinion about Baba Ramdev announcing ""Coronil""?","This is really breakthrough invention. Acharya Charaka must be proud of this invention.
Now India is going to be richest country in the world.
Thanks to Acharya Charaka and Pitanjali."
"Do three wise monkeys symbolize ""mind our own business""?","If you look deep inside the philosophy of three wise monkeys , it is greatest spiritual message in the history.
If one can overcome contamination of three senses eyes, ears and tongue ( tongue is vehicle of mind - thoughts).
He can attain silence of mind and hence can sharpen his wit.
Do three wise monkeys symbolize ""mind our own business""?
Ans : You just have to avoid bad contents and accept good contents."
How do I choose the object of meditation? How would I know that I am going in the right direction or not?,"How do I choose the object of meditation?
If you are looking for an object to choose for meditation then you are simply going to do concentration. Meditation is not concentration.
Meditation is also not contemplation.
In fact , you can't do meditation. Because meditation and doing has no relation.Meditation is all about non-doing. Meditation is all about witnessing your thoughts without any interference.

Update :- Sorry I forgot to answer second part of the question.
How would I know that I am going in the right direction or not?
Just start meditating. God is very bad photocopier. He never creates dittos whether it's persons or experiences. So don't bank on other's explainations of their experiences."
Which osho books should I read?,"Here is list of books one should read before enlightenment/awakening :-
Freedom

Everything and anything from master of masters is simply amazing. But these book will help you get started."
What is the true meaning of “one who sleeps”?,"There is something beyond the “one who sleeps”. When you sleep,eat,walk or drink there is something that is witnessing all your activities.
When one is referring to “one who sleeps” , he is actually trying to point out there is a witness to all your activities.
This world is great symphony of processes not persons or places and ONE witness in all.
You may call it God or cosmic consciousness."

What is a spiritual journey? How do I start one?,"Spirituality is something that happens automatically. As humans we are programmed to earn name and money to be respectable in society. We run for meaning outside like big house, big car, more money, more degrees, more girlfriends etc. etc.This is a journey for meaning outward. When something bad happens like death of loved one or divorce then one sees the futility of running for material things and the inward journey starts. This is the start of spiritual journey.
There are two types of worldly attachments one because of the material things like house,car, gold or money and second is because of relations. When one comes to a point where all this seems evanescent/impermanent, the inward journey of spirituality starts.

"If Osho was asked what is the art of living your life, what would be his answer?","It is impossible to answer this question on behalf of Osho. Osho had always been unpredictable. His answers always came from beyond our imagination. His answers were non-serious yet profound.
Osho used to speak in present tense. He used to speak from heart. He used to speak to confuse; make you think and to awake you.
If anyone can answer this question then he must be Osho himself."
"Why during meditation, my eyes naturally opens and starts concentrating between my eye brows?","Sw Jai Deep : You are doing meditation. Am I right?
Amrutha : Of course “Yes”.
Sw Jai Deep : Do you do breathing ?
Amrutha : Of course “NOT”
Meditation is like breathing. You can't do meditation. It happens when you don't do anything. Meditation is non-doing. Meditation is like watching muddled water clearing. Just sit and watch your thoughts coming. Be witness to your thoughts. Soon you will experience deep silence between thoughts. Gaps between the thoughts is meditation."
"How do I get into a ""trance"" (thoughtless mind) through meditation?","Mind is chaos. Mind keeps thinking even while you are sleeping in form of dreaming.
If you meditate by witnessing your thoughts; there will be gaps between thoughts. These gaps are gaps of no-mind - thoughtlessness.
If you keep meditating for years ,these gaps will become longer and longer and one fine day one of the gap will become permanent. You will enter permanent state of no-mind. This is called Samadhi.
Samadhi is also called Turiya. There are three state of our being waking, dreaming and sleeping. Fourth is not state it is our nature and called Turiya (the fourth). Turiya is state of thoughtlessness."

"Are twin flames real? Or is this concept just a way of feeding our ego and satisfying our need to be with another and connecting on a deeper level which each human desires? I used to believe in twin flames, I no longer believe they are real.","Twin flames concept is real but this happens one in a million. Twin flames concept is overused and commercialized like matrimonial and dating sites. Bases of dating and twin flames is deep desire to be loved and be with someone you are attached to.
Twin flames consultants talk of twin flames between opposite sex only not between same sex.
To understand it better let's dig deeper into Tantra.
Tantra says you can make anybody your twin flame if you can match your Kundalini Chakras with your partner.
Body has energy centers in etheric body and if that centers match with somebody then there happens instant connection.
This connection is also called soulmates.
To find your soulmate you will have to work on your etheric body which will activate wisdom of your soul and which will help you find your soulmate/twin flame."
"It has been 3 weeks since my meditation, and for 2-3 days iam not able to sleep. My inner voice goes on singing some sort of songs and im not able to sleep. Is it bcoz of meditation. Need help to overcome this situation?","When you meditate your mind starts losing grip on your consciousness. In a way, you start to go deeper into silence. When mind starts to lose its hold , it plays all kind of games to resist its absence by throwing hallucinations. Mind becomes acquainted with meditation technique after few weeks or months.
One way to engage mind is to change the meditation technique after every few weeks other way is to give it a break of few weeks.
Don't worry keep meditating, your mind will subside and you will attain silence."
Why is meditation the best compared to other yoga?,"Combination of yoga and meditation is best. Yoga is for healthy body and meditation is for healthy mind.
Everyday 45 minutes Yoga and 15 minutes meditation is all you need to live healthy life."
What is the first step on a spiritual path?,"Spirituality is something that happens automatically. As humans we are programmed to earn name and money to be respectable in society. We run for meaning outside like big house, big car, more money, more degrees, more girlfriends etc. etc.
This is a journey for meaning outward. When something bad happens like death of loved one or divorce then one sees the futility of running for material things and the inward journey starts. This is the start of spiritual journey.
There are two types of worldly attachments one because of the material things like house,car, gold or money and second is because of relations. When one comes to a point where all this seems evanescent/impermanent, the inward journey of spirituality starts.
When one's being asks questions like “What is life?” Or “Who am I?”
The journey of the heart has started.
Don't artificially start spiritual journey time will come you will not have to ask this question on Quora.
Till then:-
Eat , sleep and be merry."
"I practice Kriya yoga and brahmacharya. Last night, I had a night fall. Is it bad for my sadhna?","Spiritual practices like kriya yoga or meditation creates extra energy and body has natural tendency to convert excessive energy into sexual energy. Prana is form of sexual energy. If you had a night fall that indicates Kriya yoga is doing what it is supposed to do.
Don't feel guilty and try to overcome urge to have sex. Be aware and don't allow it to be sexually released. It will open your higher centers."
Why do trees not have a brain as a central nervous system?,"Anything that grows by itself has brain and heart but our modern science is not able to decode the nervous system of plants. Plants do have brain and heart also that is why they can sense the danger. Modern science can detect feelings of the trees. If you just pass by a tree with an axe, the tree will be frightened.
The shape and working of the heart and brain of the plants or tree doesn't match what our science knows as heart and brain. Trees are in their primitive stage. Someday when they will evolve like animals and humans they will walk and talk and run also."
How efficient is hypnotherapy in treating depression?,"Hypnotherapy is very effective alternative of medicines and meditation. Hypnotherapy yields results in few sittings. Medicines have side-effects and meditation is effective once you are cured of depression.
Combination of hypnotherapy and meditation is what modern society needs to overcome issues of mental problems."
Does spiritualism help to avoid deadly diseases?,"If one learns to work with cosmic energy, he can fight any disease in his body and he can cure deadly diseases of others.
e.g. Siddhas are people who can read aura of the people and they can predict the death of the person 6 months in advance. He can even detect covid-19 by reading the aura and eyes of the person from miles by looking at his recent photos.
They can tell you about the days left of the person by counting his breaths.
All diseases in a body are because of imbalances of the energy of chakras."
What does the Buddha's hand gesture signify?,"Shunya, zero, emptiness or nothingness."
How can I train my mind to focus only on positive and enlightening thoughts?,"Life is manifestation of duality. What you see as positive is positive relative to less positive. Life is struggle between good and bad, sorrows and happiness, darkness and light. Without duality life can't happen. Focussing on only positive is recipe for disaster. Mind has inherited machanism (fear) to prepare for negative situation.
You can't have honey without the flies.
You should understand your mind and carefully prepare yourself to be positive in every situation rather ignoring negatives."
People are washing clothes at the bank of a river and suddenly the police are rushing there to capture the dead body of a college girl. What does this dream signify?,"Dreams have no meaning at all. Dreams just facilitate you to sleep little longer or try to complete what remained unfulfilled in reality.
Suppose your body feels thirsty then you will dream of water and you will sleep little longer.
Suppose you were standing at busstand and you saw a beautiful girl approaching you and your mind expected her to talk to you but then she crossed you without talking to you.
Now your mind will complete the incident in your dreams.
Dreaming is one of the three states we live in -waking, dreaming and sleeping."
Does a dream have any spiritual meaning? I see Osho in my dreams.,"Dreams have no meaning at all. Dreams just facilitate you to sleep little longer or try to complete what remained unfulfilled in reality.
Suppose your body feels thirty then you will have dream of water and you will sleep little longer.
Suppose you were standing at busstand and you saw a beautiful girl approaching you and your mind expected her to talk to you but then she crossed you without talking to you.
Now your mind will complete the incident in your dreams.
Dreaming is one of the three states we live in -waking, dreaming and sleeping."
Why I am not feeling good even doing continuous meditation for last ten years? I feel frustration due to that.,"Hypertension/ depression and meditation has very little relation. If you have some financial or emotional problem in your life then first either you have to solve it or accept it.Meditation is not solution for sufferings. Meditation is beneficial in silencing your mind.
Meditation can bring joy to your life by making you more available to NOW. Meditation can be helpful for you to live balanced life.Meditation can improve your awareness.
MEDITATION is not a magic wand. Meditation is useless, if you are facing emotional or financial problems."
"In the Geeta Bhakti Yoga is emphasized the most and it is said to be the direct means to self realization, but as sadhguru says we need clearity not belief or disbelief, I am also not able to have full faith in devotional service, what should I do?","Bhakti and Gnana are two path to god-realization or self-realisation.
Bhakti yoga is good for people who believe in all-power God and it is very natural instinct of humans. It will suit the people who are not doubtful by nature. Anybody can follow and reach God-realization.
The path Meera, Hanuman and Kabir followed.
This is through the world of feelings.
Gnana(Gyana) is for people who are intellectuals and question everything even existence of God. It will suit highly qualified intellectuals who are doubtful of everything they have not seen or experienced. Those who follow Gnana(Gyana) path reach self-realisation/awakening. Here existence of God doesn't matter.
The path Buddha, Mahavira and Osho followed.
This is through the world of thoughts.
Whatsoever you may call enlightenment, Nirvana, god-realization, self-realisation, awakening, emptiness or Fanna. It is all one and the same thing.
It is like all rivers reach the ocean."
How do I do meditation?,"You can't do meditation. Because meditation and doing has no relation.
Meditation is all about non-doing. Meditation is all about witnessing your thoughts without any interference.
It is like when the water gets muddy and you have to search your lost toy in water. You just sit and wait till water gets cleared and you can see you favourite toy. Then you go and get it.
You just sit and watch your thoughts and after sometime you will notice gaps between thoughts and if you keep meditating for years one day one of the gap will become permanent leaving you serene forever."
"Can ""more"" meditation happen after one ""fully realizes"" that one is not the mind and body, but the ""spirit""? One has fully realized (not intellectually, but in total, living experience). What meditation can happen here?","Enlightenment is last destination. Here one becomes master of his mind. He can do or choose not to do anything. Anything means he can even choose not to be sad on demise of his loved one.
His life becomes meditation. Ultimate goal of the meditation is to attain permanent meditative state/life (Samadhi/Turiya/enlightenment) without meditation.
Meditation becomes useless on enlightenment.
Now next stage comes to work with energies of this universe.
This whole cosmos is a form of energy. Whatsoever you see or feel your thoughts, waves of the sea, stones,stars etc. All are manifestation of the same energy in infinite shapes and form."
Where is the Sahasarara Chakra located?,"Here is my detailed answer about Sahasara Chakra :-
Swami Jai Deep's post in Vigyan Bhairav Tantra"
"How does meditation happen from agya chakra to crown chakra (in the Kundalini model)? Please don't tell me it is guru's grace. If so, what meditation must happen to ""discover"" the grace?","The moment energy reaches agya chakra then there is no falling back to lower chakras. You just have to leave meditation; energy is going to hit Sahasara Chakra on full moon night (as gravitation pull of moon is highest on full moon night) regardless of your rituals or activities. Not doing anything is called zazen in zen.
Maintaining healthy eating habits and not indulging in alcohol or sedatives is all you need."
Which meditation techniques are good for women according to Osho and will you sujjest me some Osho books?,"Don't go and start shopping for meditation techniques. There is only one meditation which can lead you to silence and the final destination - enlightenment.
Meditation by witnessing your thoughts.
All meditations of Osho have one common phase of witnessing. Start meditation by witnessing your thoughts after few months of meditation your mind will start noticing gaps between thoughts. If you keep meditating for years the gaps between thoughts will become larger and larger and one fine day one of the gap will become permanent - you will enter state of No-mind.
Enlightenment- - the final destination.

Can I do meditation in the evening after sunset?,"You can't do meditation at anytime. Because meditation and doing has no relation.
Meditation is all about non-doing. Meditation is all about witnessing your thoughts without any interference.
It is like when the water gets muddy and you have to search your lost toy in water. You just sit and wait till water gets cleared and you can see you favourite toy. Then you go and get it.
You just sit and watch your thoughts and after sometime you will notice gaps between thoughts and if you keep meditating for years one day one of the gap will become permanent leaving you serene forever."
"If majority of people (including myself) have never seen or experienced any spiritual phenomena, wouldn't it be reasonable to assume that spiritual people suffer from some kind of mental illness or hallucinate about things that don't actually exist?","Mind is a logical framework, not knowing is natural state of Mind. The very nature of not knowing of mind forces it to conceptualize, conclude and complete the logic in terms of what one already knows.
There is a beautiful story of Buddha and Devdutt (Buddha's cousin). Devdutt was jealous of Buddha and he arranged a mad elephant to kill Buddha.
When Buddha came , he stuffed the mad elephant with lot of alcohol to make sure he crushes Buddha without fail. When mad elephant faced Buddha ; elephant looked at Buddha with his small eyes; and then ; bending his knees, he just bowed down in the feet of Buddha.
Devdutt couldn't believe it , but he concluded elephant was not mad and alcohol given to him was not enough then he started to arrange new mad elephant or maybe highest quality of Bourbon😉 .(Devdutt couldn't accept enlightenment of BUDDHA- such is the blindness of mind/ego).
Mind/ego is like water it takes lowest route to reach its destination."

How can I speed up a spiritual awakening?,"If this question has crossed your mind then you have become victim of your mind. During spiritual awakening no one remains there to ask this question. One comes to know all this when he completes the journey. How can you speed up something unknown beyond your mind. Your mind can comprehend something he already knows. Spiritual journey speaks the language which only enlightened can understand.
Only master can track your progress because he has already been into and out of these stages of awakening.
This is just game of mind"
Can someone test me to see if I am enlightened?,"Don't worry you are not enlightened because enlightenment is not something which needs certification. When you will be enlightened your eyes will speak and your body will reflect.
Enlightenment is not something one can miss. I am not talking about you. I am talking about people around you. They will see and feel the change in you. Your journey to divine is not something happens everyday, blessed are those who will see you as enlightened.
So relax , the day you will be enlightened your all questions will become answers."
"Will I be spiritually elevated? My DOB is 29th Dec 1982 at 5am in Roorkee, India.",100% you are spiritually inclined person and there is 100% chance that you will pursue spiritual awakening after 2022.
Is spiritual enlightenment real?,"Enlightenment is true nature of every human being. Without enlightenment everybody lives superficial life. A life of slave to mind/ego.
Mind is chaos and it makes you repeat mistakes all your life. Mind is full of silly emotions like jealousy, guilt, anger, sorrow and hatred. Your true nature is full of compassion and love.
Enlightenment breaks the false shell of your ego and gives you keys to new life.
You are already enlightened but you just have to realise.Realisation of your true-self is called enlightenment.
Enlightenment is as true as this existence.

What does it mean when finding a beautiful laughing Buddha in a flowing river in the Ganges?,"If all this have any significance then you wouldn't have put this question on Quora. You want to listen something good. If I say your luck is going for major change and you are going to find hidden treasure. Then you will waste time in stock market or some jackpot games and if possible you will go to some Casino and try your luck.
Fortunately,
Laughing Buddha and Ganges all are just things.They mean nothing.The highest power is within you. Why to waste time in outer things when you have power to control your destination within you.
Whatsoever happens to you, start taking responsibility of it."

What if I meditate for 5 hours a day for 6 months?,"Your very question is coming out from your ego. Ego wants you to conquer Everest. Ego likes challenges like 5 hrs or 6 months meditation - Gahan Sadhana.
Mind plays games of all kind and you are victim of your mind/ego.
You are advised to start meditating for as short as 8 minutes/day and then increase it by 4 minutes every 15 days.
Happy meditating."
Is enlightenment pointless? Why are we trying so hard to wake up and remember who we are when Source/God/Absolute is trying so hard to forget and lose itself in creation? Why escape Samsara if God will eventually erase enlightenment and start again?,"We need enlightenment because there is no God. Enlightenment releases you from hypothesis of God. You become God of yourself. You stop living like a puppet.
You stop living unconscious. You start to enjoy the play we know as world. Eat,drink and be merry."
How do I turn the mind from seeking to non-seeking?,"Honestly there is no switch behind the head we can push to change the mode of mind on fly. What you are referring to non-seeking is called Samadhi. One enters Samadhi on spiritual awakening.
Back to your question :-
The very nature of the mind is seeking. To put it to non-seeking is to transcend it.
You can't change the modes of mind because it has only one mode that is seeking but you can certainly witness your mind that will silence your mind and you will have fewer thoughts. This is called meditation by witnessing.
You can witness anything dynamic like river flowing, your breath, sunrise, chirping of birds or sound of wind anything moving.
Meditation will silence your chaotic mind."
"Why is it that the closer I get to awakening (non-attachment, impersonal consciousness etc) my addiction relapses get worse, nostalgic feelings heighten and I further entrench myself in my identity? How can I stop my ego from delaying enlightenment?","If this question has crossed your mind then you have become victim of mind. During spiritual ascension no one remains there to ask this question. One comes to know all this when he completes the journey. How can you understand something unknown beyond your mind. Your mind can comprehend something he already knows. Spiritual journey speaks the language which only enlightened can understand.

"What should I do if I want to become a teacher like Jiddu Krishnamurti? At present, I am preparing for the engineering entrance exam but want to became a good teacher to teach about life.","Be a seeker of truth of yourself. Path of self-realisation will teach you most profound lessons of life.
To cut the long story short :-
Simply don't make goal of becoming teacher like J. Krishnamurti. Everybody on this earth is unique. God is very bad photocopier.
Find your path and just be yourself. There is lot other than J Krishnamurti. No doubt J. Krishnamurti is one of the best teacher of life, his contribution is immense but still he is just a drop in the ocean.
You start your journey rest your wisdom will take you to your destination."
Does the third eye of a person open after reaching samadhi?,"Yes, because energy moves through Ajna Chakra to Sahasara chakra causing Samadhi and first thing one notices is opening of third eye. As of my experience, when my third eye opened I could only see rotating eyeballs of people for three days even in pictures all I could see was rotating eyeballs of the persons.
Back to answer:-
After the heart chakra , energy will directly move to Ajna Chakra piercing Vishuddha Chakra. But energy will soften your throat and leaving you unable to speak for few days or months.
From Ajna Chakra there is no returning , energy will move to Sahasara Chakra completing the journey - One enters Samadhi or Turiya. Though you will experience Satori on opening of third eye.
Sahasara Chakra has two points here is my detailed answer about Sahasara Chakra :-

** I have come across 2 other people who had same experiences about third eye."
Do I necessarily have to meditate while listening to chakra music?,"Absolutely 'YES' as you will listen to chakra music it will keep you in witnessing mode and that is the mode you will be able to feel your kundalini rising. Once Kundalini will start its upward journey then you will need deeper meditation.
You can replace chakra music with chanting of Beej Mantra but meditation is must."

How does post hypnotic suggestion affect consciousness?,"Hypnosis doesn't affect consciousness. Hypnosis works on subconscious and unconscious mind. It is mind that changes interpretation of experiences and presents it to consciousness. Consciousness is like a movie screen which is not affected by whatsoever happening on it , it simply reflects.
Post hypnotic suggestions remain in subconscious and unconscious mind and whenever moment comes it triggers the distorted experience to consciousness and consciousness works according to information provided. This is how post hypnotic suggestions work."

And is it even possible to do so?,"It is possible to stay in the state of higher consciousness , it is good for consciousness but not good for body. Only awakened being remains in higher state of consciousness. One who transcends mind remains in highest state of consciousness 24X7.
The dissonance between body and mind affects the physical and mental health negatively. Most of the enlightened beings suffer health problems and die young and miserably. Few are Maharishi Ramana, Vivekananda and Osho.
Osho has written extensively about it and warned the seekers about it.
Enlightenment is kind of psychological suicide and before enlightenment one goes through lot of Complex-PTSD (Post Taurmatic Stress Disorder) also called 'the dark night of the soul' ( There are nice videos on youtube by Christina Lopes).
Complex -PTSD affects cardiac health.
My motive is not to scare you but one should know whatever he is going to attempt . I wanted to make clear negative aspects of awakening."
What is meditation? Why are there so many tricks to do meditation?,"First thing first.
What is mind?
Mind is Chaos. Mind is chatterbox. Mind never keeps quite not even in sleep. The only way to silence your mind is to meditate.
What is meditation?
Meditation is part of your basic nature. Meditation is all about witnessing. You can witness anything like your breath. Meditation is great way to silence your mind.
How to meditate?
Start with Vipassana. It is very easy meditation and chances are this is the only meditation you will ever need rest of your life. Buddha used to practice Vipassana only. Vipassana is 'witnessing your breath'.
How do I know that I am doing meditation right?
As everybody is unique. God never creates photocopies. So your experience will be entirely different from others. The best way to explore it is to start meditating.
Why are there so many tricks to do meditation?
There are many spiritual supermarkets which repack old techniques of meditation and present it to the market and the nature of mind is that it is always interested in varities or next new thing. Spiritual shops make money out of it and all seekers get self-blames and accusations of not being pure."
"How does the mind, body, and soul trinity work?","Trinity is body mind and consciousness (not soul). Soul is indivisible part of cosmic consciousness, which changes body after death.
Now how does Trinity (body,mind and consciousness) work?
Mind works as bridge between body and consciousness. Whatsoever is input by five senses is decoded by the mind into language/signals understandable by consciousness.
*** Soul is never born or die, it resides in subtle body (sukshma Sharir)."
How is coronavirus affecting our collective consciousness?,"Danger of Corona virus is affecting collective unconsciousness (not collective consciousness) ,now people are becoming more vulnerable and isolated. Humans have not learnt any lesson from pandemic like Corona Virus.
People are still living unconsciously. There is fear of death underneath conscious mind in subconscious mind. Fear of death has not liberated people to live courageously. They are trying to find every reason to forget the seriousness of pandemic.
There is a story of Buddha and Devdutt (Buddha's cousin). Devdutt was jealous of Buddha and he arranged a mad elephant to kill Buddha.
When Buddha came , he stuffed the mad elephant with lot of alcohol to make sure he crushes Buddha without fail. When mad elephant faced Buddha , elephant just bowed down in the feet of Buddha.
Devdutt was surprised and frustrated but he concluded elephant was not mad and alcohol given to him was not enough then he started to arrange new mad elephant.
Ego is like water it takes lowest route to reach its destination.
Nothing is going to change until we stop living unconsciously."
It is believed that  Buddha discovered tangible answer to human suffering in the form of enlightenment? Then why have human sufferings not abated any where including Buddhist countries? Are we missing something in his teaching  ?,"Thousands of disciples became enlightened in the presence of Buddha. Presence of enlightened master works like catalyst and fruition of disciple and master relationship - enlightenment happens very spontaneously.
Buddha's path is to transcend human sufferings, but that doesn't end human sufferings.
Are we missing something in his teaching ?
We are missing masters like Buddha. Though we have many enlightened people on earth."
If soul has no attachment towards anything. How we go to the soul level and live. Like we know something has happened our mind will give many ideas which may be true or false but soul gives the correct answer. Has anyone experienced it?,"You can access your soul's wisdom if you become desireless. Your soul will speak to you if you transcend your mind.
Soul is enslaved by worldly desires and lusts and soul lives inside subtle body which takes on new birth after death.
To get direct guidance from soul , you will have to be self-realised.
Only self-realised person can talk to soul.
Yes I have experienced it and I experience it regularly."

Can a person attain Nirvana by following the 7 paths (excluding meditation one) out of the Noble Eight-fold path given by Buddha?,"The answer to your question is “No”. You can't touch your consciousness directly till you silence your mind. You can miss some of other steps but not meditation.
Let's see why :-
There are three states of your being waking,dreaming and sleeping (deep sleep) fourth state is not state it is your nature that is called Turiya(Turiya means fourth).
On enlightenment you enter Turiya. By entering turiya you enter Samadhi.
Samadhi becomes permanent nature of your being, you become permanent witness like you meditate by witnessing in meditation. You train your brain to access consciousness directly not through mind.
Meditation is first step and also final step before enlightenment.
Surprisingly after enlightenment you will always be meditating - walking,sleeping, talking,driving your life will become meditation."
Have you ever been told not to open your third eye?,"Here's my answer to similar question :-
Swami Jai Deep's answer to Is opening chakras without the guidance of a guru dangerous?"
What is the process of self-realization? Is it possible for everyone? How?,"Is it possible for everyone?
Self-realisation is our true nature and it is available to everybody. One who seeks finds it.
There isnt any fixed steps/set rules to self-realisation. Everybody has to follow his/her own unique path. That is to say the path of Buddha and the path of Meera was different but both reached the same destination- self-realisation.
What is self-realisation?
Before we come to this question we have to understand our mind (ego). Mind is collection of beliefs and standards set by the society, religion, education and political ideology.
Self-realisation is all about transcending these conditionings and become clean slate.
What we know mind's ‘I’ is ego. Ego has a place in our survival but it also blinds us to an extent that we forget our true nature.
Enlightenment/self-realisation is our true nature. It is within us but ego can't see the closest thing and ego goes on finding it everywhere else outside like in cars, money, position, educational degrees and temples.
You are already enlightened/self-realized you just have to forego desires including the desire to be desireless.
This journey starts with following questions:-
What is life?
Who am I?
What is happiness?
What is the purpose of life?"

"How can I uproot the seed of enlightenment before it germinates into full self-oblivion? In other words, how can I forget about all this spiritual and enlightenment stuff before it permenantly damages my self-identity? How do I restore my ignorance?","Once you are in it , you are in it. There is no returning back. There is only way out is to be enlightened.
You can meet some therapist who can treat complex-PTSD (Post Taurmatic Stress Disorder). He can help.
OR
Meet some enlightened master he will help you. He can heel you with one touch in few seconds."
"Who is better, Buddha or Krishna?","Comparing enlightened being is not possible and mind(ego) finds competition everywhere. Your mind(ego) has imagined the competition between two God's (enlightened beings).
Anyhow Krishna starts where Buddha ends. Krishna lives shunyta and Buddha attains shunyta.
If Buddha has to come back after Mahanirvana, he would live like Krishna.
There is no comparison between them but both are complementary of each other."
What happens after Nirvana? Where does go after death of Nirvana?,"On attaining Nirvana one exhausts most of his energy of the body as it happens on brain level like brain surgery one is freed from desires and lust of this body and world. One can die immediately on attaining Nirvana but most of the time there remains little energy so he has to live in same body for few more years like Buddha and Mahavira lived for more than 40 years after attaining Nirvana.
But on physical death Mahanirvana happens and that is the point of no return."
How can meditation benefit because when we are not doing it mind again starts going into the negative thoughts which we don't want to remember?,"Meditation is not solution for sufferings. Meditation is beneficial in silencing your mind.
But if you are looking at meditation as remedy to end your sufferings. It is not going to help. If you have some financial or emotional problem in your life then first either you have to solve it or accept it.
Meditation can be helpful for you to live balanced life.
Meditation can improve your awareness.
Meditation is not a magic wand , it is a knack."
Should I try to open my third eye by myself at 17? Is it possible at this age?,"Here's my answer to similar question:-
Swami Jai Deep's answer to Is opening chakras without the guidance of a guru dangerous?"
What are the different stages of a spiritual awakening?,"This question is relevant to the spiritual master not for the seeker. There is only two stages of awakening that are awakened or not. Distance is always covered by one step or you can't hire helicopter and fly to planet enlightenment.
If seeker is interested in the stages of spiritual awakening then he is not true seeker. Stages and destination are the way of ego. Ego wants to know the progress ,ego is always interested in numbers ( which stage am I in? ).
Buddha never asked this question and he attained the enlightenment when his all desires died including desire to be desireless(the last hook).
Enlightenment is not worldly things , whenever there is the desire , awakening becomes hoax."

"It is said that Meera bai had poison and Buddha also but Meera bai survived whereas Buddha died, why so? One is famous for her bhakti towards Sri Krishna and another was form of Krishna himself then Why couldn't Buddha cured himself from poison?","Buddha was enlightened being and body of enlightened being becomes fragile. Enlightenment is good for consciousness but not good for body. Because of enlightenment the connection between body and mind is broken. The energy system of the enlightened being is reversed i.e. for normal human energy travels downward to sex centre but in enlightened being energy travels upward to crown (head). The dissociation between mind and body causes harms to physical body. Most of enlightened being die young few are Maharishi Ramana, Vivekananda,Osho.
Buddha died at the age of 83, because he was trained warrior and he attained enlightenment at young age. Buddha died because of age and food poisoning not because of poison.
Meera died on the very day she got enlightened."
"Whenever I try to meditate, after 7 to 8 minutes, a lizard comes and touches my foot and I get distracted. What should I do for that?","When you meditate your mind starts losing grip on your consciousness. In a way, you start to go deeper into silence. When mind starts to lose its hold , it plays all kind of games to resist its absence by throwing hallucinations.
Don't worry keep meditating, your mind will subside and you will attain silence."
Is there any relation between karma and past life?,"You are here and now. Why are you worried about past lives? There were 16 unanswered questions by Buddha :-
What am I?
How am I?
Am I?
Am I not?
Did I exist in the past?
Did I not exist in the past?
What was I in the past?
How was I in the past?
Having been what, did I become what in the past?
Shall I exist in future?
Shall I not exist in future?
What shall I be in future?
How shall I be in future?
Having been what, shall I become what in future?
Whence came this person?
Whither will he go?
Buddha says it is unwise to answer any question which sees the self as ""permanent, stable, everlasting, unchanging, remaining the same for ever and ever"" is ""becoming enmeshed in views, a jungle of views, a wilderness of views; scuffling in views, the agitation (struggle) of views, the fetter of views.""
Just meditate and learn to live here and now. People who think about past and future lives just miss the present life. Life becomes celebration once you start living the present."
How can you meditate if you remain a thief?,"Meditation is good for everybody. Meditation has nothing to with your karma. Karma (morality) is related to consciousness. Can thief be good flute player ? If yes , then he can be good meditator also. Meditation makes you more intelligent in whatever you do.
When we get tired we sleep or rest and when mind gets tired we meditate to silence it."
Who has achieved Nirvana in all of human history?,"Nirvana,soul, reincarnation, enlightenment are coined to achieve self-realisation. Only thing that is true is self-realisation. Like to understand kundalini and chakras , yoga coined 7 bodies of human and concept of Nirvana is hypothesis to create longing for eternal self. Otherwise nothing remains after death.
God was created out of fear. Nirvana was created out of greed of permanence of one's being."
Which Osho's lecture do you want to share?,"Listen to I Am An Avataar [discourse no. 20, in hindi] (feat. Ashtavakra & Osho) by Ravana Tenheads on #SoundCloud
I Am An Avataar [discourse no. 20, in hindi] (feat. Ashtavakra & Osho)"
"In meditation, they say you have to clear your mind. How do you do that? Do you really have to think of nothing?","Don't make goal of meditation. If you make a goal of clearing your mind then your ego will make it an ambition and you will struggle meditating , you will be frustrated.
Meditation is non-doing. Doing is a way of moving out. Non-doing is a way of moving in to the centre of your being.
The trick to meditate is to become observer of mind.Meditation starts by being separate from the mind, by being a witness of mind. e.g. When you look at mirror , you will only see your face if there is a distance between your face and mirror, if mirror is too close to your face you won't be able to see your face. Likewise when you become observer/witness of mind then a gap is created between mind and witness/observer/watcher.
Watching is the key of meditation. Watch your mind. Don’t do anything – no repetition of mantra, no repetition of the name of god- As you watch, slowly mind becomes empty of thoughts; but you are not falling asleep, you are becoming more alert, more aware.
As the mind becomes completely empty.Just by watching, you immediately get out of the mind.
While witnessing there will be gaps between any two thoughts and as you keep meditating these gaps will become larger and larger and one day the gap will become permanent - this is called Samadhi.
Permanent cessation of mind."
Some children claim to remember their past life but as we know it is written in our (Hinduism) books that we get human body after 8.7 million births . How is that possible or children are misguided?,"After the birth as human there are two possibilities one is soul can reborn as human again , second is one attains Nirvana and soul never returns to universe.
It is like one can fail in class 10th and remains in class 10th for three years but he can't be demoted to class 9th or 8th."
When kundalini raises how it feels when crosses each chakra?,"This question can not have generalized answer because awakening of kundalini is pretty personal affair. I mean it may be cakewalk for some and it can be very arduous.
Based on my experience , I can tell you following :-
# There are three blockages at
Swadhisthan chakra (Hara chakra) because we are pre-programmed to reproduce and all our energy travels downwards.
Heart chakra because the supression of our basic emotions.
Agya chakra (third eye) , it is centre of our consciousness and to awaken it one needs to transcend mind - one enters Samadhi on awakening of Agya chakra.
Now your question
When kundalini raises how it feels when crosses each chakra?
Everytime when chakra is awakened , you will have effects on your heart like increased heartbeats upto 170bpm and high blood pressure upto 180/120.
It is recommended that you do some yoga or exercise and make your body strong to absorb the shocks of heart. You reach enlightenment when your bhakti,gyan,karma and kriya yogis meet inside of you."
Why is Isha Kriya not yielding any results after doing it for 5 months now?,"It is natural for ego to find new fancy names and methods to try in the name of spirituality. Do you see the nature of ego , it requires magical key, it searches for best new thing, it is always interested in challenges.
For five months you have been feeding your ego. As you might know Buddha only practiced Vipassana Meditation and attained enlightenment. Surprisingly he only taught Vipassana to his disciples and thousands of his disciples became enlightened.
In spiritual journey if you seek results then your very efforts become worldly and you fall back to the game of ego.
Desires are hook to this Lilla (Maya). You make an idol of gold and start prayer. Now gold idol will feed your ego.
Do anything, maybe surya namaskar , do it without any expectations of results. Then little by little everything will fall in place and one day you will be in bliss."
"What is chakra, and how can we control it, please give detailed answer not some Google copy paste data?","Chakras demystified *No Googling* :-
There are 5 chakras that you will actually feel in your body or to be precise , you will feel four chakras in your body and one chakra just above your head.
Root chakra (Muladhara chakra) is connected to your physical body and it is felt at base of the spine.
Heart chakra (Anahata chakra) is connected to breathing, it is felt slightly left from the middle of the chest.
Throat chakra (Vishuddha chakra) is connected to your mind(thoughts) and it is felt slightly above the bottom of the throat.
Third eye (Agya chakra) is connected to consciousness and it is located in the center of the forehead between the eyebrows. Whatsoever is developed in human consciousness is because of this Agya chakra.
Crown Chakra (Sahasara chakra) is connected to bliss and it is felt just above the head like a crown.
Each chakra responds to music of particular frequency. And music is very much helpful in awakening the chakras. There are many traditions mentioning chakras upto 114. But don't wander stay with these five rest your wisdom will guide you."
How does the sound of silence sound like?,"Aum is the sound of silence.All sounds happen because of collision. But Aum is sound that appears without collision . Aum is sound of emptiness that existed before this existence (big bang). Aum is the sound of consciousness.
Aum is the first sound one hears on enlightenment. Aum resides inside all of us.
Like zen says , it is the sound of ONE HAND CLAP."
What is the difference between a soul and a subtle body?,"Soul resides in subtle body. Subtle body takes on new birth after death. Soul is embryo and subtle body is seed-shell. Subtle body is made up of desires,lust and longings. However if one annihilates thoughts(mind) and desires(subtle body dies), then there is no reason left for one to take birth again.
As subtle body dies , this ends cycle of birth and death. Soul is never born and it never dies. This is called Nirvana."

How many hours did Mahatma Buddha meditate in a day and in what manner?,"Gautama Buddha attained enlightenment (bodhi) while meditating underneath a peepal tree.According to Buddhist texts, the Buddha meditated without moving from his seat for seven weeks (49 days) under this tree.
I haven't come accross any information about how long Sidhartha used to meditate before becoming Buddha. But It is said that :-
He only practiced Vipassana Meditation.
And after enlightenment one becomes witness to himself and this world and one doesn't need to meditate because his whole being becomes meditation (witnessing)."
Is Sadhguru as an Osho copy by answer Kishore Kumar Nagure?,"Copying Osho is not an easy job. First of all to understand Osho one has to be enlightened otherwise it is next to impossible to pretend. Jaggi Vasudev (Sadhguru) doesn't belong to same tradition as he teaches path of yoga. Osho teaches path of Dhayan(Buddha's way).
There are three path yoga,bhakti and dhayan.
There is no comparison between Jaggi Vasudev (not using word Sadhguru because Sadhguru means one who teaches his experiences) and Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh aka Osho."
Do you believe in cosmic energy that can be attracted to the body through space through meditation?,"Cosmic energy and cosmic consciousness is available to enlightened beings or tantrics and it can certainly be channelized. The good example of cosmic energy SHAKTIPAT by master.
Kundalini energy is also example of hidden energy. This universe is made up of energy only. The solid material also has empty spaces in atoms between nucleus and electrons.
Einstein's theory is proved much later, it was written in hindu and Buddhist scriptures long ago."
What is the optimum age to begin meditation practice? Is it possible for small kids to meditate?,"Meditation is not question of age at all. I have seen people at the age of 70 behaving like a stubborn kid at candy store. Children are less conditioned and more open to new ideas. Their curiosity is their energy.
The day he inquires about God, this is the time he is ready for prayer and meditation. Unless inquiry has arisen in kid, there is no need to fill him with unnecessary information. The more the intelligent a child is, the sooner he will inquire about God.
There are two questions that start one's spiritual journey :-
What is life? and does God exist?"
What is ego? How can it be avoided?,"Self is that which you are born with and ego is all that you accumulate from your family, society and religion through education, culture,school,colleges and universities as knowledge and morality. Ego is your very efforts and that is why you make your ego so big that it becomes nearly impossible to forego.
In other words , ego is your conditioned mind. Millions of people pretend that they don't have ego but everybody has it. You can neither reduce your ego nor can you discard , you can only understand your ego. The day you understand your ego , it will drop itself own its on.
So the key is to understand your ego to transcend it."
Why Sahasrara Chakra Contains 1000 petals? How 1000 petals are calculated? Is there any individual breakup numbers that derives 1000 number?,"Chakras have been named according to the experiences connected with them. eg chakra between the two eyes has been named Agya Chakra because the day energy passes through it your body and senses will start obeying you. You will become master of your body's need.
Likewise last Chakra is Sahasrara. ‘Sahasrara’ means the lotus with thousand petals. The day energy reaches there your whole head will feel as if your head is transformed into a lotus with thousand petals. For the first time in life you will have experience of bliss.
Thousand petals lotus is symbolic of feeling one gets on awakening of Sahasrara Chakra."
"While practising mindfulness meditation, is it okay to pay attention to some thoughts that arise in my mind that concern me?","First thing first!
What is mind?
The mind is a constant traffic: thoughts are moving, desires are moving, memories are moving, ambitions are moving – it is a constant traffic! Day in, day out. Even when you are asleep the mind is functioning, it is dreaming. It is still thinking; it is still in worries and anxieties. It is preparing for the next day; an underground preparation is going on. Mind is all about random thoughts.
What is meditation?
Meditation is choiceless choice. Meditation is non-doing. You just watch thoughts moving as an observer.
How does meditation relax mind?
When you meditate then there are gaps between two thoughts. These gaps are equal to deep sleep moments. When your mind touches the deep sleep for few seconds or milliseconds, your mind and body relaxes.
This happens everyday in your sleep , it is not something beyond your experiences.
The key is to be aware of being sleepy while meditating.
What are the benefits of regular meditation?
When your thoughts are more organized then your presence of mind will improve. Your creativity will skyrocket.
Meditation makes you more efficient in what you love to do.
How long should one meditate?
Start as short as 8 minutes in the morning.
Then 8 minutes in the morning and 8 minutes in the evening.
When you become comfortable with 8 minutes then increase it by 4 minutes after every 15 days.
Maximum 45 minutes meditation will change your life.
Remember :- Meditation is not a work, it is a play--- meditation is not something to be done to achieve some goal, but something to be enjoyed as a play itself. Meditation is not to be forced, it should come as natural as your breathing, your heartbeats. — Swami Jai Deep"
Does prana violet healing really work?,"Prana Violet Healing is done using the PRANA HEALING WAND ( PHW ). Wand is a cosmic geometry which continuously emits prana, the divine energy.
The Wand is used to sense the aura and to detect faults in the person’s Chakras such as negative energies, presence of negative emotions, souls, energy blockage etc.
Prana Violet Healing is very effective in healing of unbalanced kundalini/chakra blockage."
"This is an open and a challenging question to all long term Vipassana practitioners. Do you experience any phenomenon of spiritual absorbption in the practice of Vipassana? If yes, for how long and how often is it experienced?","Vipassana,challenge, phenomena, spiritual absorption, how long, how often.
These words are good to inflate your ego. Ego loves challenges. Ego loves achievements.
Vipassana is dhyaan not race."
What are the best meditation techniques to increase concentration and reduce stress?,"What is meditation?
Meditation is part of our basic nature. Like when you get disturbed, you like to pray and you feel calm. Meditation is great way to silence your mind.
What is mind?
Mind is Chaos. Mind is chatterbox. Mind never keeps quite not even in sleep. The only way to silence your mind is to meditate.
How to meditate?
Start with Vipassana. It is very easy meditation and chances are this is the only meditation you will ever need rest of your life.
Everybody is unique?
God never creates photocopies. So your experience will be entirely different from others. The best way to explore it is to start meditating."
What is the best thing that Osho Rajneesh has said that changed your life?,"Every word he said is as good as gold. But until one is enlightened most of his work seems work of fiction.
Here's one teaching that changed foundation of my being:-
“Be a witness.”
Sakshi Bano.

Is it true that Buddhism is considered as incomplete in China without the teachings of Bodhidharma?,"Bodhidharma was founder of zen. He spread Zen in China.
Zen is combination of Buddhism and Taoism.
Zen believes in sudden enlightenment and based on koans and concepts of Buddhism."
"Can you reverse enlightenment? Like try out the consciousness upgrade and then if not satisfied, simply return to your default memories and identity?","There are three states : waking, dreaming,sleeping; and the fourth is not state - that is our self-nature, our being - Turiya.
On enlightenment consciousness reaches to turiya. One who attains to turiya passes through all three states. He is awake even in dreams, he is awake during deep sleep, he is also awake during waking state.
Once one attains turiya, there are irreversible changes to default settings of the brain. One starts living by consciousness and mind becomes slave and mind can be called on demand.
It is impossible to reverse enlightenment.
By the way , who would like to reverse the enlightenment. Enlightenment is your true nature."
What is meditation and how one can meditate?,"Meditation is part of your basic nature. Like when you get disturbed, you like to pray and you feel calm. Meditation is great way to silence your mind.

How do I avoid unnecessary thoughts and tensions?,"Gurdjieff's (Armenian Mystic) father's last message while dying:-
His father said, ""If somebody insults you, irritates you, annoys you, just tell him, ‘I have received your message, but I have promised my father that I will answer only after twenty-four hours. I know you are angry, I have understood it. I will come after twenty-four hours and answer you.' And the same with anything. Give a gap of twenty-four hours.”
Following this message it created new kind of crystallization in Gurdjieff, because after twenty-four hours he could think more calmly, more quietly.
After 24 hrs everything becomes calm and you can see more clearly.
This very habit will bring new foundational crystallization in your nature.
So whenever you have negative emotions like anger,gulit,hatred and jealousy , just put it off to next day."
"Can people explain their enlightenment journey if they have been enlightened? After all, enlightenment is considered to be the pinnacle of human achievement.","Enlightenment is not pinnacle of human achievement. First of all enlightenment has nothing to do with achievement. Enlightenment is all about losing. Enlightenment is like peeling every layer of an onion.
During our journey of life we gather lot of dust of conditionings, conditionings of the society, religion and political ideology.
We all are unfortunate to be born as hindus,muslims, Christians or XYZ. Because society needs us to conform to their standards. We are being manipulated in the name of caste,religion, country or poor and rich, achiever and loser.
Die for religion, die for country, die for caste or some die for love.
Everything we get from society, family or country creates prison and we think we are free because we live in democracy.
Gurdjieff said, “If you wish to escape from prison, the first thing you must realize is that you are in prison.”
Enlightenment is all about recognising the prison and breaking free of all conditionings.
Enlightenment is your true nature.
PS: You don't know thousands of enlightened people who have lived and died , because they had no such talent that they may become visible to ordinary people. They may have had something unique like immense quality of being silent,but that will not be noticed much.
Enlightenment doesn't make one superhero overnight."
Ji What's your take on the use of psychadelics? Does it hinder spiritual growth?,"Visit my answer to similar question.
Swami Jai Deep's answer to How much faster you can spiritually develop yourself (access higher consciousness or become enlightenment) using psychedelics vs just doing meditation for long periods of time about like 5 years lets say, for example?"
Who can help for enlightenment and Kundalini awakening in India?,"Path of enlightenment is pretty personal affair. Nobody can help you to attain enlightenment. Path of every enlightenment is always unique. Though the destination of all path is same - Samadhi - state of no-mind.
Kriya yogi can give you pointers to awaken Kundalini. Path of kundalini awakening is well documented and there are thousands of people who have awaken their kundalini.
Some of Gurus can awaken your kundalini just by touch of hand, this process is called SHAKTIPAT. Some times your Kundalini can awake during Satsung or discourse of Guru, this is called GRACE."
"When you're spiritually awakening, how do you manage conflict? Do you feel the need to help everyone understand their true value, being passive? Or do you defend your ideas no matter what even if that creates more conflict?","For an enlightened everybody is enlightened. Nothing or nobody in this world is without purpose or reason. Dissolution of his ego helps him manage conflicts easily. Because ego creates conflicts , ego tries to dominate, ego tries to possess. Conflict is trait of mind/ego.
In the presence of enlightened , everyone feels love and affection and most of the time presence of enlightened being dissolves anger and conflicts.
Enlightenment eliminates the urge to dominate, possess and compete."
How was Buddha able to leave the attachment of love (romantic love)? How can one do so?,"We are born empty and we keep accumulating material things like educational degrees, bigger cars, bigger houses and more girls and in this process our ego starts becoming more vulnerable. We start living life full of fear of losing ourselves (ego). This is outward journey.
But someday when loved one dies or divorce or break-up happens then a question arises out of nowhere - “What is life?” The day your being asks this question your inward journey starts.
This is called spirituality. Detachment of relations and material things happens on its own. It can't be intentional. If it is deliberate, then it is mindgames.
Mind becomes master when you feed him with negative emotions like jealousy,guilt,anger and hate.
But mind becomes servent when you practice positive emotions love, forgiveness , surrender and thankfulness.
UPANISHADS SAY THIS WORLD IS LEELA. THAT IS WHY WE HAVE RAM-LEELA AND RAS-LEELA."
Who do you think have deepest wisdom? A guy who've read everything from Osho and Jiddu Krishnamurti or a guy who've de-patternize society standards and have true original thoughts?,"The one who've read everything from Osho and Jiddu Krishnamurti, anything and everything and then transcended everything he read attaining state of no-mind.
Simply, one who is enlightened."
Is it fine to perform complete breathing yogic exercises and meditation on bed?,You should always meditate higher than the floor. As body becomes more tangible and powerful on floor making meditation more difficult. Some of the Rishis used to meditate on branches of trees.
Does meditation provide internal satisfaction?,"Meditation is part of your basic nature. Like when you get disturbed, you like to pray and you feel calm. Meditation is great way to silence your mind.
Mind is Chaos. Mind is chatterbox. Mind never keeps quite not even in sleep. The only way to silence your mind is to meditate.
How to meditate?
Start with Vipassana. It is very easy meditation and chances are this is the only meditation you will ever need rest of your life.
As everybody is unique. God never creates photocopies. So your experience will be entirely different from others. The best way to explore it is to start meditating."
Can we draw in energy through the chakras?,"Energy can be transferred and stored through chakras as chakras are energy centres. All the pranic healing is based on transfer of energy through chakras.
Shaktipat is well known example of cosmic energy transfer via Ajna Chakra (Third Eye).
Lord Shiva used to leave his body after storing enough energy in seven chakras for months. Anybody who can store energy in seven chakras can have out of body experience and can perform astral travel also."
Do autobiographies always tell the truth?,Autobiographies are always exaggerated facts. Autobiographies are twisted truths. Autobiographies are full of stories which can't be cross-checked. Autobiographies are full of rosey photographs. Autobiographies are to inflate ego of the author. Autobiographies are great way to learn copywriting of advertisement.
"How did American business tycoons like Steve Jobs, Jack, and Mark Zuckerberg get introduced to ancient practices of meditation?","So many Westerners including Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg had visited Indian Ashrams during 1970’s for enlightenment. They are true seekers of truth. They came to India to meet many enlightened guru including Neem Karoli Baba of Rishikesh, Uttarakhand.
Meditation is part of their lives (unfortunately Steve Jobs is no more with us) and no wonder if they are enlightened too."
Is it a miracle that Gautama Buddha attained enlightenment under the Pipal tree?,"India has always worshipped the peepal tree. In that sense, the peepal is a unique tree among all the vegetation on earth.
Anyone can say that it was just a coincidence that Buddha sat under that Ficus religiosa tree. But during last ninety years, science has found a gland between the two eyes which is the most important gland in the human body. Whatever consciousness has grown in man, it is due to the secretion from that gland. And this gland is the same as that which has been called the third eye by the wise men of the East. The secretion that comes from that gland – and without which consciousness cannot evolve in man, intelligence cannot grow in man – surprisingly is found in large quantities in the peepal tree, the bodhi tree.
Read The Occult by Colin Wilson.
It is not just a coincidence that Buddha attained enlightenment sitting under this tree, it was a conscious choice. To sit and meditate under this tree is a part of a scientific process."
"Why I saw Buddha in my dream even I am Muslim, he was smiling at me and what I remember is that to grant my wish I was burning in fire? What was that buddh ain dream","This dream has roots in your previous life. You were a male in your previous life and you just missed the chance of Nirvana.
Now this is a reminder to you to complete what you left incomplete in your previous life.
You should start reading Sufism."
Did Gautama Buddha ever call himself a Buddhist?,"Jesus was not Christian. Krishna never called himself Hindu. Buddha was Buddha not Buddhist.
Every religion is commercialization of sacred soul and religions are cults, where gullible people are controlled and robbed in the name of god.
Everybody is prisoner of standards set by society, religion and political ideology.
George Gurdjieff said, “If you wish to escape from prison, the first thing you must realize is that you are in prison.”
Prisons are built by manipulating thoughts :-
Die for religion. Die for country. Die for love.
Life is greatest gift don't waste it for anything except freedom."
What do you do in a situation when your spouse is not in sync with your spiritual journey?,"Who needs spouse in the path of self-realisation? Jean-Paul Sartre said, “Other is hell.” In fact everybody not only your spouse will be against your seeking of truth.
There are two attachments in life one is of material things like house, car, gold and other is attachment of relations. You can't be free till you detach yourself from these two worldly attachments.
Path to realisation requires you to be desireless including desire to be desireless.
Path of self-realisation is like becoming seed so that you leave behind ego(mind) and come out renewed like new plant from seed.
Death and resurrection are steps to self-realisation."
Can you tell me about HGH meditation? Can I increase height of a 25 yr old male and has it any side effects?,"HGH (Human Growth Hormones), produced by the pituitary gland. It helps to regulate body composition, body fluids, muscle and bone growth, sugar and fat metabolism, and heart function.
HGH are produced every morning at around 4 AM. HGH is matter of your physical body and meditation is good in improving your brain functions. Meditation won't be helpful in increasing your HGH directly.
To increase HGH you will need to have suppliments and regular exercise. Typically, the lower body exercise like SQUAT,DEADLIFTS AND LUNGES helps to increase HGH.
Artificially, you can have direct shot of HGH by injection. But it has side effects.
Conclusion : These ayurvedic suppliments are very helpful in increasing HGH and testosterones levels.
Liv 52 ( for absorption of nutrients)
Tribulus (Gokshura)
Ashwagandha
Regarding height , due to change in posture and changes in body formation , height will increase upto 1–2″ in 6–12 months."
What is the strangest way to enlightenment?,"Every path that leads to enlightenment is always unique and strange though the destination of all path is same. Path of enlightenment is very personal affair. It has many permutations and combinations. So every path to enlightenment goes through unknown territories and finally leads to SAMADHI - Enlightenment.
Enlightenment is state of no-mind. Enlightenment is all about transcending role of mind as master.
Enlightenment is our true nature."
How does meditation helps in cleaning the past karma?,"You are here and now. Why are you worried about past lives? There were 16 unanswered questions by Buddha :-
What am I?
How am I?
Am I?
Am I not?
Did I exist in the past?
Did I not exist in the past?
What was I in the past?
How was I in the past?
Having been what, did I become what in the past?
Shall I exist in future?
Shall I not exist in future?
What shall I be in future?
How shall I be in future?
Having been what, shall I become what in future?
Whence came this person?
Whither will he go?
Buddha says it is unwise to answer any question which sees the self as ""permanent, stable, everlasting, unchanging, remaining the same for ever and ever"" is ""becoming enmeshed in views, a jungle of views, a wilderness of views; scuffling in views, the agitation (struggle) of views, the fetter of views.""
Just meditate and don't make any goal of meditation. The moment you meditate with a goal in your mind your meditation becomes struggle between ego and ambition.
Meditation is all about non-doing. Just slip into recesses of silence of your mind. Doing and achieving is nature of your mind. And meditation is all about transcending your mind."
What is the difference between enlightenment and awakening?,"It is said that seven days after his enlightenment the Buddha passed a man on the road who was struck by the radiance of his face and his peaceful presence. The man stopped and asked , “ my friend, who are you? Are you some angel or God?”
“No,” said the Buddha.
“Well, then , are you some kind of magician?”
Again Buddha answered , “No.”
“Are you a man ? “
“No.”
“Well , then what are you ?”
The Buddha replied, “I am awake.”
Buddha means “one who is awake.”
Self-awareness is conscious mind + awareness. There is subject and object also.
There is self as mind’s ‘I’. There is duality.
Enlightenment is beyond duality of subject and object.
When mind ‘I’ dissolves - it is called self-realisation.
When existence merges in your being that is called enlightenment.
When dew drop merges into the sea, it is self-realisation.
When Ocean merges into dew drop , it is called enlightenment."
Should I stay alert to attain enlightenment/self-realization?,"Your very question shows your desire to attain. Any desire will become blockage to your path to enlightenment.
Drop all kind of desires including you have to attain to enlightenment; including desire to be desireless and then you will be able to drop ego.
Enlightenment comes when you are not; it happens when you are not in moment of doing.
That is why enlightenment happens at night.
Drop the idea of becoming (becoming enlightened) . Becoming is game of mind and enlightenment is state of no-mind."
People tend to fascinate by the good things any individual preaches and the number of people follow him. How can an ordinary person tell if a person is genuinely spritually enlightened or not?,"Your question assumes enlightened guru can't be fraud is totally wrong or rather enlightened guru can be very good at exploiting human frailties.
Enlightened guru can be dangerous to disproportion. Even the enlightened beings remain human beings, not saints or superheroes, and that we all share the same cosmic identity regardless of our class and social standing.
To cut the long story short :-
If you feel good in presence of Guru then this is green flag.
If you feel comfortable with his answers to your questions then this is red flag.
Conclusion : Genuine Guru will make you think, he will throw you in furnace and melt you to mould you in new form/being.
He will be interested in your complete mutation."
"In my dream, my father died. What does it imply in my waking life?",It means you had a nightmare last night.
What is the kundalini awakening process in females? What is celibacy in case of a female? Is kundalini awakening comparably easier for females?,"Kundalini awakening in women is totally different as polarity of chakras is different and there is issue of celibacy because of mensuration (their sense of physical being is very strong because of mensuration). Mahavira and Buddha never wanted to accept women as their disciples.
First chakra ie Muladhar chakra in men- it is male and in female it is female.
Second chakra ie Svadhishthana chakra in men- it is female and in female it is male.
So the starting process of kundalini differs drastically.
Women have receptive nature and men have agressive nature.
Women can awaken kundalini by love and devotion ( heart chakra) and men can awaken kundalini by power of aggression (Manipura and Vishuddha chakra).
Though woman can awaken kundalini with the help of man by using Tantra.
Tantra doesn't discriminate between man and woman."
How can Buddha be fully enlightened when any others are not?,"There is no degree of enlightenment. Either you reach home or you are on the way. There is no such thing as my left leg has reached home and right is outside. There are three ways to be enlightened :-
Shiva - the way of body using tantra.
Krishna - the way of heart - devotion like Meera.
Buddha - the way of mind - logic and doubts like Buddha.
Buddha was first to reach enlightenment by mind so he had shown new way of logic and doubts.
Do you remember name of first one to land on moon ? - Neil Armstrong.
Do you remember name of second one to land on moon? - ???. I don't remember either.
Buddha is leader in his category - first human to reach enlightenment by using mind - logics and doubts.
Buddha survived approximately 40 years after his enlightenment. His teachings spread throughout South Asia , Japan and Korea also. At the time of Buddha thousands his disciples attained enlightenment.
Enlightenment is your true nature. Everybody is enlightened only difference between Buddha and us is we have yet to realise."
"Can Kundalini open the blocked chakras, or do we need to open the chakra before the kundalini awakening?","Buddha and Mahavira never talked about chakras and kundalini. It is not because they didn't have kundalini awakened rather their passage was so clear that they didn't feel any chakras. One feels chakras if there is blockage. Osho talked about kundalini and chakras extensively (he himself went through Anahata chakra blockage - also called “dark night of the soul”). Osho invented many meditations to awaken kundalini.
So answer is you need to open chakras to awaken kundalini if there is blockage or if your passage is clear ,you will never feel any chakra while awakening of kundalini.
Now mainly there are two blockages one in lower chakras at Anahata (heart) chakra and one at Ajna chakra (third eye) at higher chakra. Heart chakra blockage is also called - the dark night of the soul (there are many informative videos on youtube by Christina Lopes about dark night of the soul).
For Anahata (heart) chakra one can remove blockage by practicing surrender, forgiveness and gratitude.
For Ajna chakra one needs more disciplined meditation and yogasanas.
I hope this answers your question."
Can you share your experiences during and after Vypassana meditation?,"Nature never creates photocopies of people,places or experiences. Everytime you do something you come accross something new. Like if you read a book seven times you will come across new revelations seven times.
Experience of two persons can't be same or rather two experiences of same person can't be the same.
Details of my experience of meditation won't help you instead it will make your mind imagine and then confirm those imaginations to my descriptions.
Meditation is very personal affair. Those who give steps and descriptions about meditation are egotistics.
I suggest you to start your journey of meditation with open mind and discuss all that you experience first-hand."
"On this day, Gautama the Buddha was born. Will this be a reminder that if you have the necessary focus, enlightenment is a living possibility?","Path Buddha had shown will remain regardless of Buddha's presence. Enlightenment is our true nature. Enlightenment is not something beyond our being. Enlightenment is all about transcending role of mind as a master.
Buddha means awakened one. Everybody on this earth is buddha. Only problem is some come to know it and most of us miss it.
We miss seeing the things which are near to us and our mind keeps looking every nook and corner except inside.
The day you turn inward , you will find your Buddhahood.
You are Buddha but you have to realise it by going deeper into valleys of your emptiness.
Everybody borns with a question mark in his heart.
“Who am I?”"
Which form of yogic or meditative exercise did Gautama Buddha do to achieve enlightenment?,"Gautama Buddha attained enlightenment (bodhi) while meditating underneath a Ficus religiosa. According to Buddhist texts, the Buddha meditated without moving from his seat for seven weeks (49 days) under this tree.
Buddha used to meditate using Vipassana as meditation technique."
"What is necessary for maintaining yourself, meditation or gym?","Healthy mind resides in healthy body. While meditation is for healthy mind so as gym is for healthy body.
This is what I follow - 4 workout / week
7 meditation sessions / week
3 yoga sessions / week
Wake up 30 minutes before sunrise and if you skip something continue with rest of the schedule.
Don't forget to eat healthy also. Surprisingly if you eat healthy ( healthy means less sugar, less fat and less salt) then you can achieve good balance of health with 45 minutes brisk walk only.
Eating healthy is the key rest you can adjust according to your schedule."
Does listening to the same song over and over prove as a great focusing tool?,"Listening to same song over and over again is like listening your lover saying , “l love you, I love you” again and again. It implies that song has touched your heart and it will keep your mind entertained till you get bored of it and you come accross new catchy tune and lyrics.
It is not focussing tool, it is great entertainment and relaxing music. You can focus on stationary/static thing not flowing. Song is like river flowing to the sea. You need something like a point/drawing on the wall to focus."
"Do you know about these words? अप्प दीपो भव',","These are Buddha's last word and it is essence of Buddha's teachings :-
Be your own light."
What is Carvaka materialism?,"Charvakas was eastern equilent to Western Epicurous. He said , enjoy eating butter (Ghee) even if you have to borrow. Don't be worried about paying it back. This life is of two days. Everybody has to die sooner or later. Everything will be left behind then why to worry. There is no sin or evil.
If somebody is drowning, don't help him. It is his luck to drown or not.
Live your life in style.There is nothing beyond this life.
Charvakas was atheist and hiendonist. Epicurous was materialistic.
Charvakas happened to live well before Buddha."
Is religion a form of mind control?,"Priests and politicians are members of mafia which controls your mind and soul. They are not interested in individuals , they want herd of common minds which they can control for their benefits like power and money.
Die for love.Die for religion. Die for country or die for anything like flag. Society gives you false value system and everyone thinks he is doing everything out of his will.
One lives his whole life as prisoner of thoughts he is implanted with by society, religion and politics.
George Gurdjieff used to say before you ask for freedom, first you should realise that you are in prison."
Does Buddha attaining enlightenment prove that it is not necessary to have a guru for spiritual awakening?,"Happy Buddha Purnima! 7th May 2020.
Though Sidhartha had many Guru but when he saw the futility of doing everything he started his journey on his own or rather he left his desire of enlightenment altogether and then one morning it happened.
In the age of internet when answers to every question is available on finger tip then who would run the risk of having fraud guru.
One can certainly pursue spirituality without Guru, all you need is smart phone and a sincere question in your heart :- “ Who am I?”"
How can we distinguish between a fraud and an enlightened guru?,"Your question assumes enlightened guru can't be fraud is totally wrong or rather enlightened guru can be very good at exploiting human frailties.
Enlightened guru can be dangerous to disproportion. Even the enlightened remain human beings, not saints or superheroes, and that we all share the same cosmic identity regardless of our class and social standing.
To cut the long story short :-

He will be interested in your complete mutation."
Can a yogi control hunger indefinitely during meditation?,"Yogi can live without food and water indefinitely. Yogi knows the secret of converting sun energy to prana and can take water from the atmosphere directly. There are many yogi who are alive without water and food for more than 25 years.
Read book “ Autobiography of yogi” by yogi para"
How can anyone improve their meditation skills during a lockdown in 2020?,"Meditation is not skill. Meditation is art of non-doing. Doing is occupation of mind and meditation is all about non-doing. Skill is for achieving mind and meditation is all about just witnessing the thoughts of mind. You can silence your mind as you continue to meditate.
Start meditating today and don't make any goal of it. Meditation is ecstasy of just being."
Why does one feel sleepy and yawn while chanting a mantra?,"Mind needs occupation. Mind can't sit idle. Mantra chanting is mind-trip. Mantra chanting is an escape like smoking or chewing gum. Mantra is good tranquilizer. Mantra is like mother's lullaby to a restless child. Mantra creates inner monotonous music which creates boredom and boredom leads to sleep.
Mantra chanting is opposite of MEDITATION.
Meditation is non-doing. Meditation is all about being unoccupied. Meditation means state of no-mind.
If you want to sleep start chanting mantra any words will do like you can chant “ coca cola coca cola.”"
What if I meditate for 10 minutes each day for 1 month?,"Your question is coming out of desire of getting something out of meditation. Every “What if?” question is result of a business mind. We go to temple with flowers and pray to get something in return like God needs our favours. Our mind does all kind of absurd things.
You should not meditate because of any goal or desire. Meditation is non-doing. Meditation is the art of remaining unoccupied. Occupation is the business of mind and meditation is all about transcending mind.
How about you meditate till you come again on Quora and telling everybody benifits of meditation?"
Is there any evidence to support the idea of attaining samadhi?,"First thing first!
Q. What is Samadhi?
Samadhi is state of no-mind. It is cessation of mind as master of one's being.
Q. Is there any evidence to support the idea of attaining samadhi?
There are thousands of people who attained Samadhi and living blissful life. Enlightenment/Samadhi is our true nature. Surprisingly everybody is capable of attaining samadhi/enlightenment. Enlightenment is all about losing everything rather than attaining.Mind is a myth that we all spend life with. Mind is cause of all the sufferings in life. Mind is conditioning by our surroundings like society, religion , ambitions and desires. Once you transcend mind you become enlightened.
Evidences won't help you to taste samadhi rather start meditating and soon you will have glimpse of it.
Learn to swim by diving into the ocean."
"Which is best, testosterone or Deca Durabolin?","No steroid is better or worst, it all depends on your goal, whether you want to bulk up or cut fat. Deca will help your body retain water and will result in size and strength gain. Testosterone will help you cut fat and increase strength.
My suggestion is to have a professional trainer / doctor advice and have a complete anabolic steroids Cycle , diet and exercise regime.
PS: Anabolic steroids are not healthy and may cause serious health problems without expert advice."
"To prevent carrying on the remains of an addiction to our next life, for example food addiction or cigarettes, should I eat/smoke more and more till I am done with it or logically convince my mind to get over it?","Neither you should over-indulge in addiction nor you should leave it all together. Guilt is the main reason to keep you in confusion. In confusion one doesn't remain aware and his state of awareness is clouded by unnecessary thoughts and feelings.
What is the key?
You should enjoy your habits , good or bad doesn't matter. If you start enjoying your bad habit, your awareness will increase and in awareness someday you will be able to quit your habit forever consciously.
The only sin in this world is to do things unconsciously."
How can I take samadhi or prepare myself for it?,"No one can take samadhi knowingly. Samadhi happens like sudden clash of thunder. Samadhi is Mahamrityu, because it is cessation of mind as master of your being.
You can certainly prepare for great occasion by meditating and keeping your body healthy as the Samadhi takes lot of energy. You can include meditation and yoga in your daily routine. Avoid alcohol and non-veg food. Start taking sattvic food making your body light and your mind clear of toxic."
"I got initiated into Karuna Reiki recently. However, off late I haven’t been able to beam any energy into the 3rd eye. Beaming into other chakras is happening just fine. I am suffering from depression. What could be causing this?","Your depression is because of blockage at heart (Anahata) chakra. If this blockage of energy is cleared then you will be able to focus on third eye.
You need to contact your Reiki Guru. He will be able to help you. Once your blockage is cleared your depression will also disappear."
Why is meditation so powerful?,"There is no power either in meditation or in mantras. All the power lies within you. Meditation just focuses all your dispersed energy like a lens focusing rays of the sun.
There is no power outside of human. All the spiritual practices are to uncover the power we have within us.
If we align ourselves to laws of the universe then we are able to find hidden wonders of the existence.
Don't buy any wise words in the name of spirituality."
"If religion gives some people hope, what gives atheists hope?","Overconfidence of Atheist as God of his own creation is basic element of survival. Their grandiose image is enough for his belief in Darwin's theory of evolution :-
Survival of the fittest.
In fact not believing in God gives lot of power as compared to believing in God gives only hope.
Though it is nearly impossible to convert atheist to a theist or vice-versa.
So the question is rather like TV channel political debate where everybody barks for 30 minutes and in the end there is no conclusion."
Why does it happen that as soon as I experience something (while in meditation) I start imagining situations where I'm sharing it with my friends and relatives and then I'm distracted? Is it my ego?,"This is because of mind games. Mind always starts with goals and that is what you want to share with your family and mind reverses it and makes you experience so that you share those experiences with your family and friends.
Because experiences are just games of your mind they shatter like dream.
Your mind always looks out for self-approval and for that it weaves all the imagnery situations when you meditate.

What is meditation?
Meditation is choiceless choice. Meditation is non-doing. You just watch thoughts moving as an observer.
How does meditation relax mind?
When you meditate then there are gaps between two thoughts. These gaps are equal to deep sleep moments. When your mind touches the deep sleep for few seconds or milliseconds, your mind and body relaxes.
This happens everyday in your sleep , it is not something beyond your experiences.
The key is to be aware of being sleepy while meditating.
Let the thoughts come and go , you remain WITNESS to the thoughts.
What are the benefits of regular meditation?
When your thoughts are more organized then your presence of mind will improve. Your creativity will skyrocket.
Meditation makes you more efficient in what you love to do.
How long should one meditate?
Start as short as 8 minutes in the morning.
Then 8 minutes in the morning and 8 minutes in the evening.
When you become comfortable with 8 minutes then increase it by 4 minutes after every 15 days.
Maximum 45 minutes meditation will change your life.
Remember :- Meditation is not a work, it is a play--- meditation is not something to be done to achieve some goal, but something to be enjoyed as a play itself. Meditation is not to be forced, it should come as natural as your breathing, your heartbeats. — Swami Jai Deep"
How do I attain the stage of Nirvana without any help of an external substance?,"Making Nirvana a goal of your spiritual journey is more like business. Spiritual quest is not wall Street, where you think about deals and profits.
You can't buy Nirvana at Madison Avenue.
Your spiritual quest should start with :- who am I? What is life? What is my true-self?
If you ask right questions , you will get right answers."
After forcefully opening third eye… There is a great amount of turmoil…can you give some advice to close it?,"If you are feeling pressure or tingling between your eyebrows or you are feeling pressure or tingling on the crown of your head. Then your third eye (pineal gland) is activating/opening. You feel the greatest sensation at first instance when third eye opens. Thereafter, the sensation is kind of moderate and steady.
To close the third eye (Ajna chakra or Agya chakra) switch your focus to physical surrounding or doing usual stuff or you have to release energy hovering at third eye through muladhara (root) chakra.
Take lukewarm water and put your feet in water , close your eyes and put your left palm at forehead and right palm at chest , feel the energy moving from third eye to heart chakra and down to root chakra.
It will take 10–15 minutes to deactivate third eye."
How can I control all 100% of the power of my mind?,"First thing first!
What is mind?
The mind is a constant traffic: thoughts are moving, desires are moving, memories are moving, ambitions are moving – it is a constant traffic! Day in, day out. Even when you are asleep the mind is functioning, it is dreaming. It is still thinking; it is still in worries and anxieties. It is preparing for the next day; an underground preparation is going on. Mind is all about random thoughts.
How can you control mind?
To control mind you have to go beyond. Anything you do to control mind by mind will always be of mind only (it is like dog chasing his tail).
To control your mind (100%) you need to attain state of no-mind. The state of no-mind is called Samadhi.
How can meditation lead you to no-mind?
When you meditate then there are gaps between two thoughts. These gaps are state of no-mind. When you keep meditating these gaps become larger and larger and one day one of the gap becomes parmanent - the state of no-mind.
From state of No-mind you can control your mind.
It is easier to supervise from top of the mountain than from the valley."
"Is state of samadhi (Stillness /Emptiness) during deep meditation dangerous? Can we unknowingly die in deep state of meditation? Yes?, If no, then how to come out of it while being in deep meditation when there are no thoughts only awareness exits?","The Samadhi happens only once in life. Samadhi is a state of pure consciousness and it is the cessation of mind/ego. It is a state of no-mind.
Awareness takes over control of your mind and now mind can be called on-demanded.
Before samadhi mind is master and awareness is dependent on mind, in Samadhi awareness is master and mind is a slave. Awareness is pure consciousness.
Samadhi is the point of no return. Samadhi is the death of the mind as a master.
I have never heard of anybody died in deep meditation but one who attains Samadhi will always die in Samadhi."
What will happen if I meditate 15 hours a day? Will it lead to any complications?,"What will happen if I meditate 15 hrs a day. Will it lead to any complications?
One Complication is already there - your ego. Your very question is coming out from your ego. Ego wants you to conquer Everest. Ego likes challenges like 15 hrs or 7 days meditation - Sadhana.
Mind plays games of all kind and you are victim of your mind/ego.
You are advised to start meditating for as short as 8 minutes/day and then increase it by 4 minutes every 15 days.
Happy meditating."
"Dougles conquered his fear of water once he nearly drowned. He says, ""There is terror only in the fear of death."" Do you agree? Express your views.","Conquering one fear doesn't make you fearless. There are hundred and one fear lurking inside of everyone. Fear is basic survival instinct of every living being on this earth. If someone is not afraid of death then he is afraid of God. Fearlessness is phoney.
Nobody can be free of fear. Fear can only be understood. By understanding fear one can transcend the fear.
“Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less.” - Unknown"
How does force breathing differ from quiet breathing?,"Generally when one starts meditation such as Vipassana , he breathes artificially according to direction of mind and it feels like your mind is breathing in you lungs. This is called forced breathing.
Quiet breathing means natural breathing witnout any interference of mind.
Vipassana is all about observing your quiet/natural breathing, just be watcher of breathing without any control or interference."
Is it good to wake up at 3:00 AM and meditate?,"Yes as today first braham mahurat started at 4:09 and this is most receptive time of day and most of the serious meditators meditate at this time as this results in collective superconsciousness to work together to help you meditate deeper and manifest anything you want in life.
Reasons:-
There is less traffic of thoughts , no traffic noise, less pollution, less radiations like of cellphones, clear weather, capacity of thoughts to travel far, your clear, active and peaceful mind."
"Is it necessary to practise meditation, or not? Many are happy even without practising meditation. Why should I meditate?","Why do people drink alcohol? Why do people take Marijuana?
Do you think people find joy and fun .
Of course not, the fact is people try to forget themselves by taking alcohol or drugs.
While people enjoy artificial means , there is better way to enjoy this life.
Meditation is true art of ecstasy. Meditation is balancing bamboo stick to walk on tight rope of life.
Meditation gives new perspective and dimensions to your life.

I have been practicing meditation for nearly a year now but my anxiety levels haven't reduced a bit. They look more magnified than ever before. What should I do?,"Hypertension/ depression/anxiety and meditation has very little relation. If you are facing problem of hypertension because of relations or financial problems then meditation won't help. You need to set your life and your relations right.
Meditation can bring joy to your life by making you more available to NOW. MEDITATION is not a magic wand. Meditation is useless, if you are facing emotional or financial problems"
How does mindfulness help lower blood pressure in hypertensive patients?,"Hypertension/ depression and meditation has very little relation. If you are facing problem of hypertension because of relations or financial problems then meditation won't help. You need to set your life and your relations right.
Meditation can bring joy to your life by making you more available to NOW. MEDITATION is not a magic wand. Meditation is useless, if you are facing emotional or financial problems."
"When you were practicing meditation & suddenly, have you ever felt your body becoming heavy rigid and internally afraid?","Meditation makes you leave mind. When your mind looses grip on consciousness then mind resists and plays all kind of games making you scared(sometimes making you feel dying) so that you stop meditating.
But if you keep meditating then mind will ultimately lose grip on consciousness - this state is called Samadhi - the cessation of the mind.
Meditation is of no use , if it doesn't lead to enlightenment."
How do I increase my daily meditation time?,"Don't make goal of meditation. If you make a goal of meditating longer then your ego will make it an ambition and you will struggle meditating for longer , you will be frustrated.
Meditation is non-doing. Doing is a way of moving out. Non-doing is a way of moving in to the centre of your being.
The trick to meditate is to become observer of mind.Meditation starts by being separate from the mind, by being a witness of mind. e.g. When you look at mirror , you will only see your face if there is a distance between your face and mirror, if mirror is too close to your face you won't be able to see your face. Likewise when you become observer/witness of mind then a gap is created between mind and witness/observer/watcher.
Watching is the key of meditation. Watch your mind. Don’t do anything – no repetition of mantra, no repetition of the name of god- As you watch, slowly mind becomes empty of thoughts; but you are not falling asleep, you are becoming more alert, more aware.
As the mind becomes completely empty.Just by watching, you immediately get out of the mind.
While witnessing there will be gaps between any two thoughts and as you keep meditating these gaps will become larger and larger and one day gap will become permanent - this is called Samadhi.
Permanent cessation of mind."
"Can meditation, yoga, and medicine cure my depression?","Combination of yoga and meditation is going to work on physical and emotional level. If you just incorporate yoga in your daily life , that's going to work too. But if you can do meditation also then it is going to give you results quicker.
If you can devote few minutes in the evening for prayer that's going to work like magic."

What is mind?
The mind is a constant traffic: thoughts are moving, desires are moving, memories are moving, ambitions are moving – it is a constant traffic! Day in, day out. Even when you are asleep the mind is functioning, it is dreaming. It is still thinking; it is still in worries and anxieties. It is preparing for the next day; an underground preparation is going on. Mind is all about random thoughts.
What is meditation?
Meditation is choiceless choice. Meditation is non-doing. You just watch thoughts moving as an observer.
How does meditation relax mind?
When you meditate then there are gaps between two thoughts. These gaps are equal to deep sleep moments. When your mind touches the deep sleep for few seconds or milliseconds, your mind and body relaxes.
This happens everyday in your sleep , it is not something beyond your experiences.
The key is to be aware of being sleepy while meditating.
Let the thoughts come and go , you remain WITNESS to the thoughts.

Meditation makes you more efficient in what you love to do.

"Why is it that when I meditate, my throat goes to yours?","*Let me put your question the way I understood.
Why is it that when I meditate, my throat goes sour?
If it is happening frequently. There is blockage of energy at throat (vishuddha) chakra. There is one way to ensure that by quitting meditation for a week and see if there is some improvement. If YES, then you can be 100% sure that there is energy blockage at throat (vishuddha) chakra.
Solution :
This simple practice will unblock the energy blockage at vishuddha (throat) chakra.

What are some meditation techniques that can be practised to control thoughts?,"You can never control your mind. One who says he can control mind , he doesn't have mind. Mind is chaos , a strom. Have you ever seen something like controlled Strom?
Mind is turmoil. If you can control mind knowingly or unknowingly you will move towards state of no-mind.
Meditation can help you understand your mind and attain state of no-mind - the silence.
How to meditate?
Just choose slient place and sit there, close your eyes and just watch your thoughts moving.
There will be gaps between two thoughts and this gap is state of no-mind. If you keep meditating these gaps will become larger and larger and one day gap will become permanent - that is called Samadhi- parmanent state of no- mind, then the cessation of mind will also be cessation of sorrows parmanently."
"I used to be a music artist, but now I can’t express myself the way I used to. It’s like I’m blocked. One of my chakra points is blocked. Am I making any sense whatsoever?","You are perfectly making sense as I can see your wisdom is telling you that there is something wrong with your energy system.
Body has wisdom to detect and correct any problem with body or mind.
To cut the long story short :-
You have stuck at heart (Anahata) chakra. When there is blockage at heart chakra then your mind doesn't work on trivial issues and the creativity is lost. Sometimes this can lead you to severe thoughts of suicide. You move like a ZOMBIE. (This happens when there are strong emotional problems or issues).
Solution :-
Try to be with your family as long as you can. Watch your childhood movies. Don't meditate or pray. Play your favourite sport. Read books on your favourite subjects.
Light exercise will do the trick. Live your life as if this is your last day.
This might take upto 3–4 months but you will come out with flying colours.
Best of luck."

"Is there anything in nature which doesn't have duality, like day/night, light/dark?","Life exists through duality. Like two wings of the bird. Life needs duality to exist. Life cannot exist without polar Opposites. Life is a dialectical process between day and night, between life and death, between good and bad. Manifestation is not possible without duality. Our very language is limited by the duality of existence.
Only God can transcend duality of life. Where duality ends , godliness starts."
"How do we make a balance between physical, mental, and spiritual health as the people are looking for financial success only?","There can never be balance between spiritual and material life. Yes, you can have balance between religious and material life.
Religious life is just a display of your moral purities like material life.
Spirituality and material life are diametrically opposite. Spirituality has its roots inside while material life has its roots outside.
No body can pursue/balance spirituality as it happens at inner most plane of your existence. When everything in this world seems useless, when your ambitions become useless , when your being becomes hollow bamboo then the music of spirituality arises out of flute of your hollow Bamboo.
Life is not like walking on tight rope. Life controls you. Don't make mistake of controlling your life. Let every moment become joy. Whatsoever comes accept and express gratitude to it.
Live life as it comes. Your wisdom will guide you just about everything."

Can we go into our past lives using hypnosis?,"All memories of our past lives are stored in unconscious mind and above it we have subconscious and conscious mind.
To access the memories of past lives upto 7 births we shall have to bypass conscious and subconscious mind.
Hypnosis can let you access past lives but you will be unconscious while accessing past lives memories. The moment you come back to conscious mind you will not remember anything about past lives.
There is other technique to go into past lives that is called jati-smaran regression. There is a difference in jati-smaran regression and technique of hypnosis while regressing you go into past lives with consciousness ; in hypnosis you are taken into past lives by making you unconscious.
Be careful with such things as it can be frightening."

Only enlightenment is true freedom from body and mind."
"I keep dreaming a bit strange. I realise it’s a dream at that time, but I cannot wake up. I still can have control on my dream. Is it a psychological problem or is it normal?","Your subconscious mind tries to complete the dream and your conscious mind knows it is a dream.

Don't worry you are having normal dreams and tendency to complete is pretty normal."

When fear hovers 24x7 then it becomes terror. Don't let this fear become terror. There is nothing can be done about fear but you can understand fear.
In Nov 2019 you were busy setting up printing shop hoping that is the last thing you needed but in March you again standing where you were in October 2019. What if you again become what you were in October 2019.

Synthetic Bindi will hamper your third eye activation."
Why do some people not like Osho's ideology?,"Central theme of Osho's teachings is enlightenment.
Every enlightened being is dangerous for people like priests and politicians. People who want to rule you. Politicians rule your body and mind , priests rule your soul. This is a mafia of prestige and power.
Enlightenment is always result of rebillion nature. One who doesn't accept the things because of faith or beliefs. He has to inquire true nature of mind. He can stake his life to find truth of himself.
I read somewhere once Osho went to Pundit Jawaharlal Nehru and asked him to include his teachings in syllabus of schools and colleges. Nehru simply refused his proposal , just because no one can rule the rebels and osho always advocated freedom from all superstitions, phony ideologies and traditions.
This society and religion keeps conditioning us to be useful to society. The very root of our society is rotten because society is selfish.
Selfishness is basis of our existence so as they sow so shall they reap.This vicious circle goes on. But society enjoys your slavery , your helplessness.
As Osho said, “Enlightenment is the only revolution.”"
"Is it true that consciousness creates reality and the world? Great scientist J. S. Bell said this, I am fully convinced that it has a central place in the ultimate nature of reality.","Whatsoever we perceive by our five senses is ultimately acknowledged by our consciousness.

But when one goes beyond five senses then consciousness directly access this world without any distortions of mind and five senses.
Accessing reality directly by consciousness is called enlightenment."

Meditation is being witness- the choiceless choice."
Is Ashwagandha good for boosting testosterone?,"Ashwagandha is known to reduce stress and helps silent sleep. Due to quality of sleep body produces more Human Growth Harmones (HGH are produced in sleep at 4 am in the morning) which is buliding blocks of muscles in human body. That results in more testosterone.
Ashwagandha and gokhru (Tribulus terrestris) combination is best for boosting testosterones."
Can meditation be done by hearing Om music and simultaneously concentrating on breathing?,"Meditation is observing not concentrating. You can meditate with Om music but then you are suggested to observe Om music not your breathing.
If you want to observe your breathing then Om music will be distraction.
Find a silent place and sit there , close your eyes and just observe ( concentration is not meditation) your breath.
Meditation is all about silencing your mind."

What is the scientific explanation of following each of the precepts in Vipassana?,"Science and meditation are diametrically opposites hence meditation can't be explained by laboratory.
The definition of science is knowing more and more of less and less. Meditation is just observing (in case of Vipassana, your breath).
Science understands by dissection of things. If science has to understand brain, brain has to be dissected and the moment brain is dissected , it dies. Dead brain is entirely different than living brain.
To know meditation, you will have to meditate and that too without expections."
"In case Shiva is divine, then why would they maintain sitting all times and meditate on which god?","Meditation doesn't require God. For those who meditate the very meditation becomes God.
God is a hypothesis which we need as a hook to hang our heart and mind on.
Concept of God came out of fear. Greater the fear , stronger the devotion will be.
And primarily if we take away concept of God from a theist then there is chance of him to go mad/neurotic so meditation is replacement of God."

Is it possible for anyone to achieve enlightenment in a short space of time?,"Your very question is coming out of your impatient mind.
Zen saying: If you are in a hurry, you will never arrive. You can even arrive just by sitting, but in a hurry you can never arrive. The very impatience is a barrier.
The enlightenment is sudden, but the preparation is very long. It is just as you sharpen your axe well before you cut the tree. Sharpening of axe is as important as your strength to cut the tree.
If you are in a hurry, then it will be better to be interested in marijuana than into meditation, because drugs can give you dreams, instant dreams, sometimes of hell, sometimes of heaven.Hurry won’t help.
Bring down your impatience."

2) Whatsoever is remained unfilled in reality will come as dream in sleep.

Dreams are illusions they never come true."
How can I hypnotise myself in 10 minutes?,"Hypnosis you are talking about is called autohypnosis.
It can be done by following steps :-
Step 1 : Set alarm of 10 minutes and repeat to yourself 3 times that within 10 minutes , when the alarm goes off , I will come back from deep hypnotic sleep.
Step 2 : Look at some shiny light and go on repeating inside , “ My eyes are becoming heavier and heavier and I am falling into sleep. I can't keep my eyes open anymore; I am trying my best,but it is impossible” - it takes exactly 3 minutes.
Note : Try your best to keep your eyes open so that they become heavier and heavier.
Step 3 : Now you are in autohypnosis , you can easily put any SUGGESTION like I have left smoking. Put only one suggestion at a time.
And when the alarm will ring you will be back from deep hypnotic sleep.
Whatsoever you put in third step will become part of your subconscious mind.
PS : You can also use cellphone playback for autosuggestion."

"Practicing meditation for almost 7-8 years, Recently whenever I meditate I feel like I'm about to die, all my perception of time physical body and gravity looses, such a weird and SCARY feeling, what should I do now should I stop meditating? HELP","There are six layers( layers are listed at end of the answer) of ego (personality) and when we meditate for many years the layers are peeled like peeling an onion.
You have entered death layer of ego and your ego is about to die , this is also called - “the dark night of the soul” - ( there are very informative videos by Christina Lopes on YouTube).
If you be aware and keep meditating then you will enter LIFE (new life) layer and your old ego will die and new birth will begin from LIFE layer, then there are two possibilities one you can become epicurous or Buddha there is one more layer to enlightenment that is BLISS , once you enter BLISS layer you become Buddha.
Both possibilities are beautiful.
Frederick S. Perls has listed six layers of ego in his book :- Ego, Hunger, and Aggression
Here are list of layers :-
Layer one : In this people live artificial life like if they go to funeral they cry with others but their tears mean nothing. They say Hello but to avoid people. This layer is called CHICKENSHIT.
Layer two : This layer is pure ego. It is like - I AM PRESIDENT OF AMERICA. I AM HUSBAND OF MISS UNIVERSE. People in this layer are bit better than layer one but dangerous because they become politicians, police officers etc.
This layer is called BULLSHIT.
Layer three: When something bad happens in layer two like death of loved one or divorce then people like poets, authors, musicians, lyricists or people good at heart fall to third layer. This layer is called CHAOS. Here people either become alcoholic or druggist or go back to layer two.
If one remains meditative and aware then he enters next layer.
Layer four: This is DEATH layer ,where you touch death experiences of yourself and your loved one.
If one remains aware in this layer by meditating then he or she enters LIFE phase.
To be frank, in this layer you need a MASTER who can give birth to your new ego otherwise you will move like zombie or you will revert to layer two.
Layer five : This layer is called LIFE.Your new ego has to take new form and new dimensions of loving and compassionate life.
You can become epicurous or Buddha, if you remain aware.
From here MASTER can't help you. You will be guided by your wisdom.
Layer SIX: This layer is called BLISS. If you come to this layer then you have possibility of becoming BUDDHA- full of pure love and awareness."
What is the most powerful technique of meditation to achieve supernatural powers?,"Meditation has got nothing to do with supernatural powers. Meditation is concerned with your peace of mind.
You try to find domination in material world by buying expensive cars , expensive clothes, bigger house or being powerful physically by going to gym.
Now with same attitude you are carrying , seeking same dominating powers in meditation , believing in supernatural aspect.
Meditation can lead you to inner peace and it can lead you to your true-nature or true-self."
Why do most of the time spiritual leaders talk of so much fiction and no practicality?,"Human mind only knows language of symbols and metaphors hence mind loves any explanation by stories and fictions. Anything that is said directly is not taken seriously. Mind loves drama and exaggeration.
If lessons of Geeta is said directly by some normal person, will that have same impact that of Lord Krishna?
Whole human history and present is full of stories and fictions take bollywood , serials or any success story in magazine.
Stories are best way to influence mind."
What should be the duration of meditation per day for beginners? Can one meditate in the evening hours?,"Meditation is something of non-doing. It can be as short as 8 minutes or it can go upto 45 minutes to hours.
For beginners start with 8 minutes and when you can meditate comfortably for 8 minutes then increase it by 4 minutes and likewise increase it by 4 minutes every 10–15 days. For anybody 45 minutes meditation is ideal and practical.
Regarding time you can meditate anytime , empty stomach is recommended.
I have observed meditation brings faster results in the morning time. The reason is mind is naturally silent in the morning and till evening mind goes berserk.
That is why we love chirping of the birds and nature's sounds in the morning.
Prefer morning for meditation and evening for prayer.
Otherwise doing something is always better than not doing at all."
Does meditation start from root to crown chakra or can I directly start meditation for the third eye chakra?,"Start meditating without any intention of focusing or concentrating. You never know which chakra is going to respond first. Don't force to concentrate on specific chakra. There are primarily four main chakras in body :-
Muladhar chakra
Hara chakra
Heart (anahata) chakra
Ajna chakra (Third eye)
Muladhar chakra and Hara chakra are already awakened in humans and animals also. You just have to be aware of sensations while meditating.
Once you get started then your wisdom and body will guide you."
Is it possible for a person to become a very rich businessman and later become a spiritual guru leading a spiritual life?,"‘ Becoming’ is a disease for spiritual journey. Your basic question is based on achievement and achieving mind can't be spiritual.
In spiritual journey one has to lose everything including but not limited to desires , ambitions and material things.
“Enlightenment is a destructive process. It
has nothing to do with becoming better or being happier. Enlightenment is the
crumbling away of untruth. It's seeing
through the facade of pretence. It's the
complete eradication of everything we
imagined to be true.” - Adyashanti"
What are some of the best books one can read during the Qurantine?,"Any book from SantataGamana.
The perfect way by Osho
Freedom by Osho
Fear by Osho
Any book from bhagwan shree Ramana Maharishi.
Any book by Nisargadatta Maharaj."
Can an allopathic doctor cure an ailment caused by the wrong Kundalini awakening?,"Allopathic doctor can give you some sedatives or tranquilizer and put your mind to rest and then you can keep your mind off meditation and kriya yoga , whatsoever you were doing for kundalini awakening.
Tantra yoga allows use of psychedelics and whenever kundalini gets wacky , one can get relief using psychedelics."
Why do some people say that asafoetida (heeng) should not be consumed?,Asafoetida causes impotency and excessive consumption is not recommended. It is good for digestion. It is chiefly used where garlic and onions are not used.
What does Lord Shiva's Ardh-Narishwar form represent?,"Ardh-narishwar form of Shiva is tantric representation of Lord Shiva. Shiva is half man and half woman. Half woman represents shakti (Parvati).
Tantra believes every man is half-man and half-woman and every woman is half-woman and half-man. Every man tries to find woman outside for satisfaction of sexual desires and every woman tries to find man outside for satisfaction of sexual desires.
But if a man finds his inside-woman then orgasm can happen inside the man only without outside woman and that is called ultimate absolute bliss or enlightenment. Similarly if a woman finds inside-man then orgasm can happen inside the woman without outside man. This is called state of bliss."
"In context to Lord Shiva, what does Satyam, Shivam, and Sundaram mean?","Satyam = truth ; Shivam = Godliness; Sundaram = Beauty.
Truth can only be seen without ego(mind) and when you see real truth there is only divinity (Godliness) and beauty resides in divinity of truth only."
Is Abhigya Anand enlightened?,"Of course not, because he is know-it-all kind of guy. He may be good in mathematics but he is not enlightened.
Enlightenment takes all knowledge away and makes one as innocent as child ( without curiosity). See Bhagwan Shree Ramana Maharishi face.
Anybody can tell about his exaggerated predictions in few minutes.
Enlightenment and intelligence has no relationship. Enlightenment simply means I know myself."
Does meditation equals sleeping?,"There are three state of mind 1) Waking 2) Dreaming and 3) Deep sleep ( deep sleep - dreamless sleep- sleep without contents).
Out of 8 hrs of sleep mind remains in deep sleep ( where there is no dreaming) for 2 hrs only.
Deep sleep is state of no-mind - total relaxation.
What is meditation?
Meditation is all about witnessing your thoughts without interference. It is not sleeping but it has deeper meaning than sleeping, meditation has qualities of deep sleep.
When you meditate then somehow your mind touches deep sleep for few seconds on and off and it relaxes your mind and body , that is why you feel sleepy while meditating or after meditation.
There is nothing wrong if you keep meditating sooner your body will be accustomed to relaxation and your meditation will go deeper."
"In Buddhism, in order to attain nirvana, if we extinguish/destroy our mind, then how will we experience that which is beyond ""emptiness""?","First of all everything we experience is not because of mind or by mind. Everything we experience because of consciousness or by consciousness.
The mind is a constant traffic: thoughts are moving, desires are moving, memories are moving, ambitions are moving – it is a constant traffic! Day in, day out. Even when you are asleep the mind is functioning, it is dreaming. It is still thinking; it is still in worries and anxieties. It is preparing for the next day; an underground preparation is going on. Mind is all about random thoughts.
When you bypass mind on nirvana or moksha then you experience this world by pure consciousness without mind . There is no traffic and thinking has ceased, no thoughts move, no desire stirs, you are free of restrictions of mind.
So there is pure consciousness to experience nothingness and beyond.
When one attains enlightenment then mind is not destroyed rather mind is used on demand. If mind is destroyed then all one learned throughout his life will be lost and that enlightenment will be as good as going mad.
Enlightenment is state of pure consciousness without contents (mind)."
How do I come out of a fatal meditation technique? I am on death bed due to incorrect technique and lost almost everything.,"You must have stuck in death phase of awakening journey( your meditation had touched the death experiences and you were not ready for it). This is also called heart chakra, when one gets stuck at heart chakra then he moves like zombie and there are many health problems like accelerated heartbeat and high blood pressure and absent-mind.
To come out of it first of all destroy anything you have who you worship like any picture or books or idols.
Stop doing meditation.
Try to go back to normal routine. Be with your family as long as you can. Take out old books and read. Watch your all time favourite movies. Play sports you used to love.
You are going through complex PTSD (Post taurmatic stress disorder). You have lost sense of your being.
Do this therapeutic exercise for 15 days morning and evening ;-
Put your left hand on heart and right hand on forehead and breathe for 10 minutes without concentrating your mind.
There was nothing wrong with your meditation but you didn't have master to guide you. Your meditation was perfect and it did what it supposed to.
Now forget about meditation and follow what I listed."
How is Buddhism different from atheism? Why does Buddhism exist if it is atheistic in nature? Does it lack spirituality?,"Theists, atheists fundamentally suffer from same problem - the question is same , “does God exist?” - existence of God, both of them look for confirmation of their point of view.
God is greatest lie invented by humans. Existence of God is actually result of attachment theory that we live all our life.
For an enlightened person, the existence of God becomes irrelevant. Enlightened being has his own Gita, Quran or spiritual scriptures. He lives life out of heart.
Buddhism doesn't deny existence of God. Buddhism emphasizes that there is God in everybody. Everybody is capable of becoming God. Enlightenment is not prerogative of chosen few.
Every human is capable of attaining highest potential of humans."
Can learning Advaita make us move close to self-realization?,"Yes, it will make you bit closer to self-realisation. But you will never self-realize with one stream of thoughts. You will have to hit your mind (doubts and logic ) from multiple directions like tao, Sufi, buddism, yoga, Christian and all Hindu streams of thoughts.
Mind is very stubborn it can't take all the information from one source , it takes up just fraction of information from one source.
Read anything and everything till you self-realise."
What food is better at this time during the outbreak of the coronavirus?,"To fight with corona virus one needs to prepare mentally and physically.
Diet for physical fitness:-
Add sprouts to diet like sprouts of whole legumes, peanuts, black chickpeas, green peas.
Avoid ice-cream, lime juice or any sour things, curd, cold drinks etc.
For physical health :-
Take good multivitamins tablets, Liv 52, vitamin 'C', Neurobin forte (B-complex).
For mental health:-
Ashwagandha (good for brain)
Gokshura (testosterone booster) , it makes you brave against any negativity.
Light bodyweight exercises like pushups, skipping , squats will improve your immunity.
PS : If you are eggetarian then eggwhites of 4 eggs will improve your immunity."
"How is mantra chanting done, loudly or silently? Can eyes be open or should they be shut? What are other important things to keep in mind?","Mantra chanting should be done in a closed room and it should be done as loud as the sound of mantra comes back to you after reflection from walls.
Your eyes should be half-opened and your nose should be visible to you.
You can avoid distraction by chanting with mala."
"Powerfull meditations require supervision from the guru. Isn't staring at smartphone all day a form of dhyana yoga, because we are concentrated? Does it lead to mental health issues and will a guru's supervision help?","Dhaya is not concentration. Dhayan is not contemplation. Dhayan is state of no-mind. Dhayan is non-doing.
When you do anything on your smartphone , you are using your mind. Active mind can't be meditative.
Dhayan is very simple. Dhayan is all about witnessing your thoughts without interference.
When you witness your thoughts then there is a gap between two thoughts. When you keep meditating the gaps will become larger and larger and one day that gap becomes permanent - that is called samadhi.
The state of no-mind is called samadhi."
"I meditate for 10 minutes, after which I usually want to sleep. Why is it so?","Mind is a monkey. It keeps jumping from one thought to other. Even in sleep it hardly sleeps, it keeps on dreaming. Your mind only sleeps 2 hrs out of 7 hrs.
There are three state of mind 1) Waking 2) Dreaming and 3) Deep sleep ( deep sleep - dreamless sleep- sleep without contents).
Deep sleep is state of no-mind - total relaxation.
When you meditate then somehow your mind is touching deep sleep for few seconds on and off and it is relaxing your mind and body , that is why you feel sleepy.
There is nothing wrong you keep meditating sooner your body will be accustomed to relaxation and your meditation will go deeper."
After spiritual awakening during DNA healing can genetic disease too can be cured?,"Spiritual awakening does cause subtle changes in body that can only be observed by the subject.
There are positive changes to eyesight because of third eye activation there is a noticeable change to voice and most importantly all the heart problems are also healed.
There is certainly a DNA healing also and spiritual awakening does cause healing of genetic disease but it occurs in months of time."
What is the relationship between 'silence' and the 'inner journey'?,"This universe is born out of nothingness and nothingness is our inner truth. That is why we have lot of questions and in outer world we try to fill that void by accumulating material things like more cars, bigger house, more girls, more watches, more gold etc etc.
The moment your seeking turns inward you find emptiness (the silence) inside and the futility of material accumulation is also felt.
Inside of all of us is a silence of emptiness and one who experiences the emptiness of inside becomes silent - shunya.
Experience of shunyta is state of bliss."
"What is meant by seeing the true nature of the self, and how does it look?","Most of us live our lives out of mind. Mind is stacked onto consciousness.
What is mind?
Mind is conditioning based on moral and immoral values of society. All our life we live life imprisoned by the do's and don'ts of society and family.
Mind forces us to live artificial lives based on artificial values and belief system.
Self-realisation is knowing our consciousness without mind. Consciousness without mind is pure consciousness and which is essentially the same for every human being.
Pure consciousness is full of compassion, love and awareness and that is your true nature - The truth - The answer to all your answers."
What is the way of asking forgiveness to Kundalini energy?,"Kundalini energy is called Shakti. Shakti means Parvati and when kundalini is awakened then Shakti meets Shiva at Sahasara chakra.
So if you repeat mantra Om Namah shivay for 108 times that will do."
Is it mandatory for a spiritual seeker to refrain from marriage?,"Refraining from marriage is repression. Repression is unnatural and if you refrain then it will remain in underground but it will remain as longing. Any repressed desire will be hurdle for spiritual journey.
You should get married and if you are lucky guy then your wife may be of help for your spiritual journey.
Even Sidhartha got married and had a kid. And after enlightenment when he went to thank his wife -Yashodhara and told her that he self-realised.
She said to Buddha, ‘Couldn’t you have trusted me? You could have said that you wanted to go, and I would have been the last woman in the world to prevent you. Couldn’t you have trusted me even that much?’ And she was crying. Years of anger! And this man had escaped like a thief in the middle of the night – suddenly, without giving a single hint to her.
Buddha apologized and he said, ‘It was out of non-understanding. I was ignorant, I was not aware. But now I am aware and I know – that’s why I have come back. You have helped me tremendously. Forget those old things, now there is no point in thinking about ‘spilt milk’. Look at me! Something great has happened. I have come home. And I felt my first duty was towards you: to come, and to convey, and to share my experience with you.’
The anger gone, the rage subsided, Yashodhara looked out through her tears. ‘Yes, this man has changed tremendously.’ This was not the same man she used to know.
So go get married if it works then you can continue your spiritual journey and if it doesn't then you will be what you are at present - alone."
How are the Neo-sannyasins ordained by Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh (also known as Osho) different from other sannyasins?,"This is a baiting question. There isn't any seriousness either in question or questioner.
You can find all this information on Google. Quora is meant for questions which are not available on Google."
Is it necessary to awake Kundalini to open the third eye?,"Third eye is called Ajna chakra or Agya chakra , it is sixth chakra out of seven chakras. At least following chakras are required to be awakened before awakening of third eye : -
Muladhar chakra
Hara chakra
Anahata (heart) chakra
Then you can attempt to awaken third eye.
Even if somebody happens to awaken third eye directly then these three chakras are awakened simultaneously with third eye automatically. When there is no blockage in passage then third eye is awakened directly with other three chakras.
In Tibetan Lama tradition Lamas activate third eye of disciple by operation , drilling thin hole right between eyes through the skull and inserting medicated wooden needle for three weeks exposing disciple to light slowly and letting him out after 21 days.
That is a painful process and available to Tibetan Lamas only."
Is knowledge the prerequisite for enlightenment?,"Knowledge, self-awareness and meditation are pillars of enlightenment.
Knowledge about how our mind works.
Self-awareness about our state of mind like state of anger, jealousy, guilt and greed.
Meditation is neither concentration nor contemplation. Meditation is witnessing.
When you meditate by witnessing your thoughts. There is a gap between two thoughts and if you keep meditating by witnessing these gaps will become larger and larger and one day gap will become permanent and that is called -Samadhi.
The state of No-mind.
This is enlightenment."
How many years of Constant meditation is required for a person to finally look beyond five senses in this universe?,"There is no criteria as such. But 5000+ hrs of meditation will definitely yield you results you are asking for.
In fact state of Samadhi can happen any time depending on your longing and type of books you read, type of people you hang out with.
I am sure three activities are must to self-realisation. 1) Your longing for truth of yourself 2) Your habit of reading 3) And of course the meditation is key to self-realisation."
Can focusing between the eyebrows awaken my Kundalini?,"Focussing on the third eye is useless , neither it will activate third eye (Ajna chakra) nor kundalini.
One needs to awaken at least following four chakras to activate Kundalini :-
Muladhar chakra.
Hara chakra.
Anahata (heart) chakra.
Ajna chakra (third eye).
These four chakras reside in body and all other chakras remain out of body just above head.
PS : This is my experience , it is not text taken from some book or website."
Is it safe to focus on the third eye? Can I force my third eye?,"There is no danger focussing on the third eye but it is useless , because nobody in this world can activate third eye (Ajna chakra) directly.
One need to awaken at least following three chakras before activating third eye :-
Muladhar chakra
Hara chakra
Anahata (heart) chakra
After awakening these three chakras one can try to activate third eye.
PS : This is my experience , it is not text taken from some book or website."
Hi. I have been into meditation since 3 years. And I keep hearing some messages like dates and numbers while I sit in mediation and also sometimes in meditation I feel hatred about Shiva. But in reality I worship him alot. Can you please help?,"That means your mind is at unrest. You have lot of thoughts running in your mind. There is some kind of terror of something unknown.
A fear which continously is in your mind turns to terror.
These dates and numbers are because of intuition of money problems coming soon for you to face.
If there is some serious problem in your life then first solve it or accept it.
Condemning Lord Shiva means you are angry because life is not going according to you.
Before you meditate first try to solve the problems which are haunting you or surrender to the problems and let the Lord Shiva take control.
Don't meditate for long , first start with 12 minutes and when you can meditate comfortably for 12 minutes then try increasing by 4 minutes after every 7 days. No need to meditate more than 45 minutes."
"Can you tell me why does it happen that whenever I meditate, I sit joining my palms and focus between brows, after 2-3 minutes my palms repel each other and move away as far as possible breaking namaste position?","That means your mind is at unrest. You have lot of thoughts running in your mind. There is some kind of terror of something unknown.
Don't focus for long , first start with 4–7 minutes and when you can focus comfortably for 4–7 minutes then try increasing by 4 minutes after every 7 days. No need to focus more than 25 minutes.
It is not how long you focus, it is all about regularity.
If there is some serious problem in your life then first solve it or accept it."
Are there any schools based on Osho's teachings just like the way there are Krishnamurti schools?,"There are very few people who understand Osho. Even people who have joined Pune Osho Meditation Centre are there out of fascination of Osho's revolutionary thinking. There are many devotees of Osho , but they follow him unconsciously.
Osho is ocean and one who understands him becomes quite.
I never heard of any school of Osho. And it is impossible to have school of Osho. Osho meditation and teachings bring total mutation to your being including but not limited to love, compassion, sex, life, spirituality, meditation etc. etc.
Start listening to him, start reading him. Don't look for shortcuts."
How did you know it was enlightenment and nothing else?,"T H E moment one becomes enlightened, one does not think that one is enlightened; one simply knows.It is self-evident; no certificate is needed.
When one becomes enlightened, something of God penetrates into the earth, something of the sky starts walking here on the earth. Those who have eyes can see it, those who have ears can hear it, those who have hearts can feel it, and those who are intelligent enough will learn the secret of it.
PS : Enlightenment is something that happens physiological level also and changes that happen to brain and body are very much noticable or rather uncomfortable.
PS : Enlightenment does cause awakening of 8 chakra simultaneously in one go."
Why didn't Sage Alar kalama / Udakka Ramaputta gain enlightenment even if both of them followed same method as Siddharth Gautama?,"They must have followed the same path as Siddharth, but path to enlightenment can never be same for everyone. There may be some similarities but path of enlightenment is always highly individual. That is why enlightenment is rare phenomena.
But the result of all paths is always the same - self-realisation or enlightenment or Nirvana."
When and how should a spiritual seeker decide that he doesn't need to continue routine symbolic practices as they say true self-knower need not to do all these?,"When seeking becomes so painful you don't see any light just long dark road. When you are about to go mad. When you move like zombie for months or years then there comes time when you have to stop seeking and give up on search.
Stop and go back to your routine life there is no hope your seeking was just waste of time.
There is no such thing as enlightenment , it is all hoax."
Is it wrong to aspire high in life if one also wants to pursue the path of spirituality?,"Two things are diametrically different. It is like I want to have cake and eat it too.
High aspirations is result of ego. And in spiritual journey you have to forego ego.
Ego (mind) is the reason for sufferings of life and once you disidentify from your mind , you become master of your mind.
Mind is brainchild of ego. Ego loves challenges, achievements and anything or everything on this earth.
So in nutshell you have to choose one of the two."
How do I stay fear-free when the surrounding environment and media are constantly creating fear?,"Fear is our natural instinct that help us avoid dangers. But when atmosphere is full of fear it becomes terror (continuous existence of fear is called terror).
Nobody in the world can be free of fear. But we should not let the fear become terror.
Fear can't be avoided. Once again fear can't be avoided.
Fear can only be understood. Fear is always about future , it doesn't have existence in the past or present.
If you remain in present , there will never be any fear.
News channels, newspapers all thrive on exaggerated negative news. Fear is the only hook that news channels, priests and politicians use to rule your mind and body."
What are the benefits of joining Osho meditation camps?,"Meditation and benifits are two different dimensions. If you are looking for benefits of joining Osho meditation camp, then you have already missed the point of meditation.
There is so much to explore for you before you join Osho meditation camp.
In fact there is no need to join Osho or any other Meditation camp.
You go deeper into yourself in meditation, meditation makes you alone then why to go into crowd and making things difficult.
Meditation can't be the reason to join any group."
Can we open the third eye by taking guidance from a book?,"Awakening of Ajna (Agya) chakra requires total mutation of your being (spiritually, physically and mentally).
By reading a book or two will not help or rather it will be dangerous.
Third eye opening should always be done in supervision otherwise most probably everything will be your mind games or there is chances of blindness.
I am not scaring you , but before you go on unknown journey , everything should be made clear.
Update: Nobody in this world can awaken Ajna chakra directly. One will have to awaken at least following chakras before awakening Ajna chakra (Third eye).
Muladhar chakra
Hara chakra
Anahata (heart) chakra
After awakening these three chakras one can try awakening third eye (Ajna chakra)."
Can I sell a spiritual book in a running train?,"Your question has something very significant. As I can see you are well educated. This question shows that you are going through spiritual awakening and I am not wrong.
Kind of seeds of renunciation (vairaag) have been sowed and now your heart has taken over your mind.
Your heart has started seeking the truth of you.
Back to your question :-
You can sell spiritual books on OLX and Amazon, if you like.
But try to understand yourself. You need to meditate and do anything that your heart desires."
Did Buddha believe all of his teachings literally? Was he attempting to teach a larger lesson?,"Teachings of Buddha is a framework and It is scientific also. I do think all his teachings lead one to self-realisation or enlightenment.
Buddha was first to invent path to self-realisation by mind - doubts and logics.
There are other path to enlightenment/ self-realisation.
Path of tantra : (Lord Shiva) - It is path of yogic practices - body.
Path of heart (Love and devotion) : This is path of Krishna.
Path of mind :( doubts and logics) this is path of Buddha.
The path of mind - ( doubts and logics) was invented by Buddha accidentally.
Later Buddha formalized the path by giving sutras.
My understanding is Buddha beautifully crafted the framework of teachings using only one basic truth i.e.
We all are born empty and emptiness or nothingness is our originality.
Once we empty our mind , our mind gives in and leaves us as clean as we were on our birth.
Mind takes backseat and our consciousness becomes the driver.
No, he didn't believe in all his teachings.
God,Soul, reincarnation, enlightenment or moksha all are hypothesis of grand strategy to attain state of superconsciousness - the ultimate human potential."
What is the main reason that made you love and follow Osho?,"Can you define love? Anything you will say about love will remain only words. You are asking why does Sun shine? Why does it rain?
Some mysteries are to be explored.
Listen to Osho. Read his books. Find yourself the answer to your question."
How does the root chakra feel when it's activated?,"Root chakra(Muladhar chakra) is connected to earth and it is affected by the earth rotation. While sitting in meditation, the vibrations of earth rotation is observed at the base of spine.
Otherwise if you tap heel of any of your feet, there will strong vibration like ripple at base of spine.
Try experimenting with muladhar chakra on new moon night. Results will be astonishing."
How can a person connect to someone through meditation?,"Don't set goal for meditation. If you make goal of getting in touch with someone by meditating , then you will be lost in imaginations. And when you won't be able to connect , your ego will find it futile.
Mind plays such a way it finds ego out of everything.
Meditation is non-doing. Meditation is all about witnessing. Being witness to your thoughts.
Witness to anything like sounds of birds,wind or beautiful sunset or sunrise is meditation.
Dont make meditation a goal itself.
Just go to quiet place and slip into your silence and be witness to anything. There will be gaps between thoughts. When you will keep meditating the gaps between the thoughts will become larger and larger and one day in the recesses of your thoughts the gap will become permanent leading you to state of no-mind - this is called samadhi.
Samadhi is permanent state of joy and bliss without outer things or relations."
"What is Shaktipat, and how can I receive it?","There are two ways which enlightened guru can help you with to experience divine.
One is Shaktipat and other is Grace.
Shaktipat is performed on special date and time when the disciple(devotionally) is ready to receive it. Like Guru will tell the disciple come at 5.00 in the morning tomorrow. Then he will transfer the cosmic energy to the kundalini of disciple and immediately on the touch of Guru, kundalini of disciple will be activated and this experience will open the chakras of the disciple to divine experiences. This is not permanent awakening of kundalini. Kundalini will go back to dormant state. But the experience will force disciple body to same divine experience some other day and kundalini will be awakened forever.
Grace is same but it happens own its own without any special time and touch of Guru.
Grace can happen anytime while at home or around enlightened guru. Grace is something showers 24x7 from Guru irrespective of your location. This is also transfer of cosmic energy but remotely.
Shaktipat will require you to visit Guru but grace just need your devotion to Guru. Grace can happen own its own remotely."
Does pressure of everyday like make you feel like leaving everything and becoming a monk?,"Reason for becoming monk can't be other than seeking for true-self. If reason for becoming monk is any other than that, it is cowardice. Becoming monk is not solution to insecurities of life.
Life is joy of living courageously.
One should be thankful to God and his/her parents who gave you opportunity to visit this beautiful planet called earth.
But your question has one thing significant , that is you have turned inward. Your journey to seeking the truth has started.
Welcome to the world of meditation and prayers."
How many headstands is too many headstand? And can doing wall headstand cause damage to brain or spinal cord?,"Too many handstands cause damage to brain nerves. When we stand there is lesser flow of blood to brain and when we do handstands the flow of blood to brain almost doubles. The nerves of brain have to bear double the flow of blood , hence the damage to nerves.
It is like river is overflooded in rainy season and erosion is being done by flow of water on the banks of river.
12 reps straight wall handstands and 4 sets are more then enough."
Did Osho said guru like him comes in 2500 years?,"No , he never said that guru like him come after 2500 years.
He said there will be many masters (Gurus) but the master of masters like Osho will come after centuries (2500 years).
Osho was not only master, he is master of masters."
How can I become Osho meditation teacher?,"There is no certification course in Osho meditations. First you try to master Osho meditations. If you start mastering his meditation techniques then you will leave the idea of becoming Osho meditation teacher.
You will enjoy the meditation so much that your idea of becoming Osho meditation teacher and making money will evaporate."
How do people know if someone is enlightened? Are there tell-tale signs? Are there things to be wary of? Would it be possible to identify this via neuroscience means?,"Enlightenment and enlightened being is not something you can miss easily. Your mind may choose to ignore, because ignoring is the nature of the mind. Enlightened being is one who has transcended the mind and body.
If you will come in contact with enlightened being you will feel his presence and the peace with him.
There are some physical attributes you can notice :-
Their eyes look fixed and they don't blink eyelids very often.
Their face has certain peace you can notice easily.
Enlightened being is simply a person who transcended mind and know his true nature.
You are also enlightened. But you are stuck in your mind.We can't see something very near to us. Like you can't see your face in mirror, if you put mirror too close to your face.
You can have coffee with enlightened being and yet you don't notice because enlightenment makes one simply a child without curiosity.
Neuroscience can absolutely identify the enlightened being as there is drastic change in the brain on enlightenment.
The pineal gland (third eye/Ajna chakra) is activated Bindu chakra and Talu chakra are activated and these are physical points in human brain and the sensitivity of these part are easily observable.

The day you will meet Buddha your heart will know."
"(Namaste sir) How to deal with fear during meditation (fear of seeing something strange, losing body or paranormal stuff)?","Namaste Rohit, you are lucky guy that you feel afraid while meditating. You are getting closer to yourself. This fear is natural step towards your true-self.
When you dive deeper inside of yourself. You find your self alone. This feeling of fear is because you are afraid of being alone.
Don't worry you are on right path. Don't be afraid keep meditating the first thing you will feel when you go deeper - near death experience.
But if you keep meditating, all your fears will evaporate. You will become as fearless as lion.
Don't stop keep meditating."
Who is the one watching when you meditate (soul or mind itself)?,"When you meditate then consciousness is there always watching. It is like consciousness is a movie curtain always there and your mind is movie playing on it.
Whatsoever happens in movie good or bad , the curtain will remain unaffected. So your consciousness is always there unaffected by whatsoever happening in your mind.
The one is watching is your consciousness."
Is meditation the solution for suffering?,"Meditation is not solution for sufferings. Meditation is beneficial in silencing your mind.
But if you are looking at meditation as remedy to end your sufferings. It is not going to help. If you have some financial or emotional problem in your life then first either you have to solve it or accept it.
Meditation can be helpful for you to live balanced life.
Meditation can improve your awareness.
Meditation is not a magic wand , it is a knack."
Why did Vinod Khanna join Osho?,"Vinod Khanna became fulltime Rajneeshee after the death of his mother. Vinod Khanna used to love his mother very much. Vinod Khanna was introduced to Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh by Mahesh Bhatt.
Mahesh Bhatt was also Rajneeshee. He was also struggling in his life between his wife and Parveen Bobi. Parveen Bobi also joined Rajneesh.
Later Mahesh Bhatt threw the Rajneesh mala in toilet and flushed it. After sometime he joined U.G. Krishnamurti and remained with him till hiss death. U.G. Krishnamurti called Mahesh Bhatt just before his death and after 5 days U.G. Krishnamurthi left his body in serenity.
Vinod Khanna remained around Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh and he went to Oregon,USA and worked there as Gardner in Big Muddy Ranch ( Oregon).
After the fall of big muddy ranch , Vinod Khanna returned to big screen with movie Dayawan with Madhuri Dikshit. Movie was just okay. But then after he gave many hits movies and he also joined BJP and won election from Gurdaspur, Punjab.
Vinod Khanna remained disciple of Osho till death."
How can I start meditation after office hours?,"First thing first.
Q. What is dhyana?
Ans. When you meditate there will be gaps between two thoughts and as you keep doing meditation for years the gaps will become larger and larger and one day that gap will become permanent i.e. state of no-mind — samadhi.
Our ultimate goal is to be witness ,so witnessing is best meditation.
Go to park before dawn (Twilight) or before dusk (after sunset) and sit comfortably, close your eyes and just listen to sounds of birds, wind. Just be conscious and be witness.
Initially observer will be mind and one day observer will be observed by consciousness.
That will be state of No-mind - samadhi."
Why do most truly enlightened souls become silent when they're asked to describe the moment of enlightenment?,"Enlightenment is rare phenomena and it is dangerous for people like priests and politicians. People who want to rule you. Politicians rule your body and mind , priests rule your soul. This is a mafia of prestige and power.
Enlightenment is always result of rebillion nature. One who doesn't accept the things because of faith or beliefs. He has to inquire true nature of mind. He can stake his life to find truth of himself. There is danger to life of enlightened being.
On the other hand if he tells someone that I has attained self-realisation then people don't believe him and make fun of him. So he chooses to be quite.
Third reason is the experience one goes through is not describable in words. It is really hard to put the experience in words. Words are just not enough for such a grand revelation of truth.
The fact is enlightenment is our true nature. We have drifted away from it because of our desires and achieving mind.
Enlightenment is not something special. It is prerogative of every human being. Everyone is capable of being enlightened.
This society and religion keeps conditioning us to be useful to society. The very root of our society is rotten because society is selfish.
Selfishness is basis of our existence so as they sow so shall they reap.This vicious circle goes on. But society enjoys your slavery , your helplessness.
Enlightenment is the only revolution.
If you start seeking , you will reach your true-self."
"What is the exact location of 7 chakra kundalini, mainly 2 different types I can see?","The seventh chakra is Sahasara Chakra and it is also called Crown chakra. Sahasara chakra has two part Sahasara (a) and Sahasara (b) also called the Bindu chakra is situated just opposite of Agya chakra at back of head. With the help of this Chakra we are capable of controlling hunger, remove all type diseases.
The Sahasrara Chakra(A) is located at the centre of the top of the head , at the area of a baby's frontal Fontanelle , which is easily visible in a new-born child. But when it is activated it feels like hovering just above head . Seventh Chakra disperses the Universal energy or life force into the other chakras located below. Sahasara Chakra represents the goal of all Yoga and mantra , Self-Realisation and God-Realisation, where the individual soul unites with Cosmic Consciousness.
Following pictures will help you understand :-
Bindu chakra - Sahasara (b)

What are the Ashta Siddhis? How do I gain those powers?,"As a true seeker you should not believe in miracles. Siddhis is yet another power-trip. What you seek in this world now you are seeking in divine.
Sidhis is a path of ego. Why are you interested in siddhis in first place?
Remember search for power is not the search of true seeker.
Siddhi - the power to do miracles is a vicious circle of ego-trip. Once your words begin to come true, your confidence will grow and you will feel more powerful. The more your words come true , the more you will feel yourself to be supernatural.
These siddhis are greatest obstacles on the path of self-realisation. One should keep clear of them."
What will you do in these 21-day lockdowns?,"If you want relaxing days try yoga, meditation and bodyweight excercise and skipping.
Rekindle your childhood hobbies like playing some musical instrument or painting.
Learn to publish book on Kindle and make money.
Learn about stock market read Warren Buffett to take advantage of this stock market situation and make money.
Learn about internet marketing and try learning amazon FBA and make money.
Re-live your college days watch movies like godfather, rambo, silence of the lambs, count of Monte Cristo. Dancing with Wolves, dark knight , joker, big small farm, ultimate game, terminator etc.
You can try cooking learn new recipes avoid ordering , don't go to neighborhood for drinks. Try new snax and have good time creating a mini theatre where you can have popcorns with your family.
There is lot of things to do while inside your house.
Stay at home, stay safe."
"What is the phenomenon that again & again with a great urge tries to open my eyes, when I'm already in meditation for half an hour? It says something like ""It's enough for today"".","That means your mind is at unrest. You have lot of thoughts running in your mind. There is some kind of terror of something unknown.
Don't meditate for long , first start with 8 minutes and when you can meditate comfortably for 8 minutes then try increasing by 4 minutes after every 7 days. No need to meditate more than 25 minutes.
It is not how long you meditate, it is all about regularity.
If there is some serious problem in your life then first solve it or accept it."
"Is it true that after the third eye is opened, every thought will become reality?","Reverse is true after awakening third eye you will only see the reality and imagination of mind won't happen. You will not work based on perceptions.
99% people are not awake even if they are out of bed. They move like zombies. Doing something and thinking about something else. This is how everyone spend whole life"
What is so great about the Kundalini awakening?,"Kundalini awakening awakens the dormant senses in the body like third eye and 7th chakra (Sahasara Chakra). Sahasara chakra is wonderful because Sahasara chakra never sleeps and keeps collecting sensory information available 24X7. That information is provided to third eye (Agya Chakra) for further processing. Third eye is capable of predicting future events.
Moreover the eyesight increases upto 300%.
All the heart problems like high BP will go away and you will have sound sleep without any sedatives."
Do you HAVE to travel to India to achieve enlightenment?,"Of course not, in fact you don't have to travel to anywhere not even your local supermarket.
First thing first - enlightenment is not an achievement.
Enlightenment means dissolution of ego and finding true-self.
There is nothing to be gained. Everything has to be shredded.
Buy any book on meditation on Kindle and start meditating rest your wisdom will guide you."
What can one do beside milk and ghee to regulate the heat in the body and specially in the head by Kundalini awakening process?,Try sprouts (moong dal and black choley) and ashwagandha (Himalaya brand).
Does reading spiritually open the third eye chakra?,"No, reading and agya chakra (third eye) has no relation.
Can you learn piano by reading? Can you learn swimming by reading?
There is nothing in this world you can learn by reading.
Agya chakra (third eye) can only be awakened by awakening kundalini. There is no shortcuts. You will have to be yogi.
It is long process but it is worth thousand of diamonds.
At least three chakras are important for third eye to awaken.
Muladhar chakra
Hara chakra
Heart chakra
Then you can try opening third eye."
"Are the eyes significant in meditation, when 'witnessing' - with eyelids closed? Whether there is a left dominance … or a right for instance.","If you are going to try witnessing by eyes. It will be very difficult because with eyes you can't witness , you can only visualise. It will be like imagination taking other form.
Witnessing can be done with other senses better like close your eyes and try to be witness to sound of birds and wind. With sense of smell , just be witness to fragrances. Sense of touch , just feel the wind touching you. Sense of taste , just be witness to whatever taste is coming to your tongue.
It is better you go to park (of course after lockdown) before dawn (Twilight - 24 minutes before sunrise) and just sit and be witness and when sun rises then just be witness to the beauty of the sunrise.
You can do the same at the time of dusk."
Is it good if I suggest meditation to a depressed person?,It is absolutely foolish for depressed person to do meditation because the nature of depression is to give chaotic mind negatively. Depressed person should do prayer and his faith should be reinstated in God. Then slowly slowly he will be ready for meditation.
Gautama Buddha rejected the existence of the soul while Lord Mahavira accepted the existence of the soul while both were reaches complete enlightenment Why?,"God, reincarnation,soul and Nirvana/moksha are framework to reach state of superconsciousness where person live without being slave to mind.
Mind doesn't understand direct language so we have to create metaphors and stories.
Enlightenment is a state of superconscious mind where you live in bliss but it is still a state where conscious mind is used on demand.
Normally mind is observer but after enlightenment conscious mind is observed by superconscious mind.
Mahavira framework needed soul as part of larger picture because Mahavira strictly followed fasting and celibacy, ignoring needs of body altogether , to be aware of body one needs at least one hook hence the soul is accepted and Buddha framework doesn't require God and soul because there is no discipline of fasting and celibacy is not mandatory (though it is mandatory while living in Monastery)."
"Do children themselves acquire spirituality? Is a guru required? If we determine strongly, then is it true that our soul becomes our guru?","Enlightenment means becoming as innocent as kids without being curious like kids.
Kids are already enlightened. What can we do best try not to supply them knowledge.
We should not impose religion on kids.
We should not corrupt them with false knowledge of religion.
Then they will turn into seeker themselves. Once they become seekers then they won't need Guru. Their soul will lead them to spirituality."
"Why we are living in this society, by knowing that these are all fake things? Why we are going to schools and offices? Why we are not staying in our home and meditate for maximum hours untill enlightenment?","Enlightenment is not result of meditation only. Enlightenment requires physical fitness, logical mind and great resources of knowledge also.
Hours of meditation doesn't cause enlightenment your consciousness should also evolve. Your mind should also evolve. Your body should also evolve.
Enlightenment is result of complete upgradation to your being.
After enlightenment the great struggle comes, “ How to express it?”.
Being enlightened is more challenging than otherwise."
Is there any truth in Kundalini chakras?,"Kundalini and chakras are truth of life on this earth. There are chakras in animals also and number of chakras in animals are three not more than that.
But chakras in human are 7 and only human can manipulate those chakras consciously.
Thousands of years ago Lord Shiva found kundalini awakening. That is why Shiva is still greatest God.
Since then millions of people has awakened kundalini.
Kundalini is as true as our existence."
What is the need for dynamic meditation?,"Dynamic meditation is signature meditation method of Osho.
As Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh (Osho) said that lifestyle of people has changed since Buddha. Now people are restless and there is need to incorporate catharsis and celebration together.
Dynamic meditation has four stages and each stage is of 10 minutes. Dynamic meditation works on your Kundalini. Following are the stages:-
Stage #1)
Start by standing with your eyes closed and breathe deep and fast through your nose. Allow your body to move freely. Jump, sway back and forth, or use any physical motion that helps you pump more oxygen into your lungs.
Stage #2)
This stage is one of catharsis. Let go totally and be spontaneous. You may dance or roll on the ground. Screaming is allowed and encouraged. You must act out any anger you feel in a safe way, such as beating the earth with your hands. All the suppressed emotions from your subconscious mind are to be released.
Stage #3)
In the third stage you jump up and down yelling Hoo! Hoo! Hoo! continuously. According to Rajneesh, the loud vibration of your voice travels down to your centers of stored energy and pushes that energy upward. When doing this stage it is important to keep your arms loose and in a natural position.
Stage #4)
The fourth stage is complete relaxation and quiet. Flop down on your back, get comfortable, and just let go. Be as a dead man totally surrendered to the cosmos. Enjoy the tremendous energy you have unleashed in the first three stages and become a silent witness to the ocean as it flows into the drop.
This is original dynamic meditation introduced by Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh (Osho)."
"How much faster you can spiritually develop yourself (access higher consciousness or become enlightenment) using psychedelics vs just doing meditation for long periods of time about like 5 years lets say, for example?","Psychedelics are shortcut and it was used by all time greatest yogi Lord Shiva (marijuana) and it is used like in gym we use the method of progressive overloading to build muscles.
The quantity is increased and the subject tries to be aware and alert.
This is the method all yogi use. Gurdjieff (Armenian mytic) also used to use it on disciples. It is time tested formula for quick results.
You can try it with alcohol also.
There are two problems with this methodology:-
1) The experience is not permanent and health problems are there.
2) There is no upgradation to consciousness that causes the dissonance in brain power and consciousness causing undesirable behaviour.
Meditation is very good method as it has no health drawbacks and the effect is permanent.
The drawback is the full result will be obtained after 3000 - 5000 hrs of meditation approximately around 5 to 10 years.
But the path of meditation is really worth trying or for faster results you can try combination of both. Then it will take 2–3 years."
People from ages are telling about guru's grace. Is this grace only extended to giving a technique (for in olden days they were kept secret) or it is beyond everything?,"There are two ways which enlightened guru can help you with to experience divine.
One Shaktipat and other is Grace.
Shaktipat is performed on special date and time when the disciple is ready to receive it. Like Guru will tell the disciple come at 5.00 in the morning tomorrow. Then he will transfer the cosmic energy to the kundalini of disciple and immediately on the touch of Guru, kundalini of disciple will be activated and this experience will open the body of the disciple to divine experiences. This is not permanent awakening of kundalini. Kundalini will go back to dormant state. But the experience will force disciple body to same divine experience some other day and kundalini will be awakened forever.
Grace is same but it happens own its own without any special time and touch of Guru.
Grace can happen anytime while at home or around enlightened guru. Grace is something showers 24x7 from Guru. This is also transfer of cosmic energy but remotely."
"Is liberation (Moksha) just an illusion as scripture says ""without knowing the true self one can't attain Moksha (liberation)"" and also ""the true meaning of self can't be grasped""?","Liberation/moksha is as illusionary as this world. All people who attained it, glorified it. I find it utterly useless. Utterly overrated.
Everybody has his own truth. For example Sachin Tendulkar found his truth in cricket, he became God of cricket. A.R. Rehman found his truth in music, became Oscar winner. Sharukh /Salman/Amir Khan found their truth in acting.
Though they have found their truth outward. But they live peaceful life. Ramana Maharshi, Vivekananda or Shri Nisargadatta Maharaj all found their true-self inward. They lived peaceful life.
Everybody has to die.This fact can't be ignored enlightened or not.
What is big about being enlightened.
The search for true-self is one of the most irreligious activities.
Now the question to ponder on:-
Q.Can enlightened being save us from Covid-19?
Ans : Only the scientists and doctors who think outward can save us from Covid-19.
So don't waste time and energy in the search for moksha/nirvana. These are just words to glorify the achievement of few people. There is no such thing as moksha/liberation.
if you find pleasure in playing Piano , go and play it , but play it like piano is extension of your body."
"Does a Kundalini awakened person that has had surges of energy up the chakras, have the same surges at later points in life? Or do they only occur before/during/immediately after the initial awakening process?","During initial Kundalini awakening the energy surge is maximum to agya chakra and sahasara chakra and after that kundalini goes dormant for few days.
But on full moon night it again starts the journey from muladhar to Sahasara and kundalini energy awakened to maximum. Then every new moon night it becomes weak (not dormant) and on every full moon night it is very strong.
It becomes very weak on solar eclipse night."
Why is meditation necessary for the brain as well as the human body?,"80% of our time we spend in using our mind(brain) , we hardly have 2 hrs of deep sleep otherwise our brain(mind) is dreaming (working) even in our sleep. So approximately 10% of our time we actually sleep other 10% we use our subconscious mind. Our mind(brain) gets exhausted in tension pushing itself to extreme limits. Human body is tense because of everyday extreme working conditions.
When we meditate then there is gaps (moments of no-mind recesses something like deep sleep) between two thoughts and as you keep meditating these gaps become larger and larger giving relaxation of deep sleep calming your mind and body.
That brings beauty in your actions and thinking and makes you more efficient in what you do.
NOW how to meditate?
Go to park before dawn (Twilight) and sit comfortably , close your eyes and just listen to sounds of birds, wind. Just be conscious and be witness.
After some time you will have larger and larger gaps between two thoughts and feel the difference in your daily life and calmness in your sleep."
How do I enter in samadhi?,"Don't set goal for meditation. If you make goal of entering samadhi , then getting into samadhi will become your ego.
Mind plays such a way it finds ego out of everything.
Meditation is non-doing. Meditation is all about witnessing. When you use method of Vipassana then you become witness of your breathing.
Witness to anything like sounds of birds,wind or beautiful sunset or sunrise is meditation.
Dont make meditation a goal itself.
Just go to quiet place and slip into your silence and be witness to anything. There will be gaps between thoughts. When you will keep meditating the gaps between the thoughts will become larger and larger and one day in the recesses of your thoughts the gap will become permanent leading you to state of no-mind - this is called samadhi.
Going beyond mind permanently is called Samadhi."
"What is a guided meditation on gratitude, 15-minute miracle exercise, attract abundance & miracles?","Guided meditation is done by giving suggestions by outer voice - like your Guru or it can be done by playing sugestions by playing pre-recorded sugestions in your voice.
Gratitude is the emotion where ego gives in and one finds himself at peace.
Here is few suggestions you can record at equal intervals and just close your eyes and listen to suggestions and feel them :-
Thank you God (e.g. Lord Shiva) for giving me opportunity to visit this beautiful planet.
Thank you mummy and papa for being a medium to god's will.
Thank you sun to make life possible on all planets
Thank you earth for giving us Food.
Thank you existence for protecting me
Thank you my brother for being with me in thick and thin.
**You can thank everyone ,even your enemies for instigating courage to fight.
The last part of the question is a punch gimmick - “15 minutes miracle excercise- attract abundance & miracles”."
Have you tried meditating to get out of your ego and see yourself from the outside?,"Don't set goal for meditation. If you make goal of getting out of your ego, then getting out of ego will become your ego.
Mind plays such a way it finds ego out of everything.
Meditation is non-doing. Meditation is all about witnessing. When you use method of Vipassana then you become witness of your breathing.
Witness to anything like sounds of birds,wind or beautiful sunset or sunrise is meditation.
Dont make meditation a goal itself.
Just go to quiet place and slip into your silence and be witness to anything. There will be gaps between thoughts. When you will keep meditating the gaps between the thoughts will become larger and larger and one day in the recesses of your thoughts the gap will become permanent leading you to state of no-mind - this is called samadhi.
Going beyond mind permanently is called Samadhi."
Which chakra do you believe need healing the most?,"The most important chakra is Anahata ( heart) chakra and one can get stuck at heart chakra for years.
The reason is for centuries we have been repressing our emotions and very few emotions are expressed because of moral and immoral guidelines of society.
I have heard from many spiritual teachers like Adishanti and Christina Lopes that heart chakra is biggest hurdle in spiritual awakening.
I also had stuck at heart chakra in my spiritual awakening and I moved like zombie for 17 months.
This situation is also called - “ The dark night of the soul”."
How can somebody tell the difference between a genuine spiritual master and a fake?,"If he sugarcoats everything and you become peaceful immediately then he is fake spiritual master.
If every statement of master shakes your beliefs and drives you mad then he is genuine spiritual master.
Because transformation is not cakewalk. It is more like dying and resurrection."
Is opening chakras without the guidance of a guru dangerous?,"It is possible to awaken kundalini without Guru. It is dangerous at some chakras :-
First dangerous chakra is Anahata (heart) Chakra here most of the people get stuck because we have very strong repression of emotions from many births. If one gets stuck at heart chakra he will have strong negative emotions and physically you will have high heart beat (upto 170 BPM) and high BP (upto 130/190). This is real danger.
If there is blockage at Agya (third eye) chakra then it might leave you blind permanently. Let's see why :-
When kundalini energy rises from heart chakra to Agya chakra then to burn area around (shell) pineal gland (pineal gland is physical organ in brain corresponding third eye) energy from two eyes is also withdrawn to make skull in front of pineal gland transparent. If the energy from two eyes is withdrawn excessively, then there is chance of permanent blindness.
Awakening of Sahasara chakra is also painful but not dangerous. Awakening of Sahasara causes severe pain in the back of skull on Full Moon Night ( because of full gravitation pull of moon).
But trust me if you can achieve this, it is worth sacrificing life. Who would like to live after experiencing divine?
So the answer is yes and no. If you are adventurous and ready to risk everything then you can do it without Guru. If you want to play safe, have an enlightened guru guide you."
How does meditation improve productivity?,"Regular meditation in the morning calms your mind and improves your awareness.
If you meditate daily your efficiency will improve whatever you do at work or anywhere.
Meditation helps your mind to live in NOW and living here and now is the key to success."
Is it possible to assess the health of your chakras?,"There will be clear sign of the energy blockage in chakra. e.g.
If there is blockage in Hara chakra you will be very active sexually , unable to control.
If there is blockage in Manipura chakra your digest and confidence will deteriorate.
If there is blockage in Anahata (heart) chakra your heart will beat faster (upto 180 BPM) suddenly and you will have high BP (upto 120/190).
If there is a blockage in vishuddha (throat) chakra then your throat will become soft and you won't be able to have alcohol and spicy food.
If there is blockage at agya (third eye) you will have pain in eyes and just above your nose.
If there is blockage at Sahasara chakra you will have frequent unbearable headaches on the full moon night.
Only in one condition your chakras will be healthy if kundalini arising from muladhar chakra meets at Sahasara chakra other wise kundalini energy will stick in some chakra causing health problems."
"How do you classify the leadership style of ""Satguru Jaggi Vasudev""? Why?","Autocracy is only model all the Gurus choose. There can never be any other heirarchy implemention in religious establishments. Because basic system in any asaram or organisation is based on attachment and totalitarian.
So autocracy is the right word. Democracy and dictatorship don't suit because everyone who goes for self-improvement or self-realisation needs someone who they can love from heart ( as attachment theory says) and democracy and dictatorship are form of politics."
How did Gautama Buddha attain enlightenment just by meditating? Did anyone try to follow the same?,"Whatsoever happens to one on the path of enlightenment happens spontaneously.
There is no doer. Sidhartha did nothing deliberately. It all happened because of longing to find truth of himself.
Surprisingly enlightenment happened to Sidhartha in the state of desirelessness.
Buddha found the new path to enlightenment that is path of mind - doubt and logic.
Seeking has to start on its own and when seeking becomes so painful that one leaves the desire of enlightenment , then one fine day it happens like big bang. One transcends mind and finds himself in state of No-mind- Samadhi.
Existence chooses one in million to shower gift of enlightenment."
"What actually can I do to improve myself in the 21 days of lockdown apart from reading books, doing yoga, or meditation?","If you do these three things you will not need anything else. Download kindle and read new books.

"I'm becoming spiritually awakened, now what?","Most probably You are being tricked by your mind. First spiritual awakening is not about “becoming” , it is matter of disappearing, it is a matter of dying and resurrection.
Becoming is word of mind. Spiritual awakening is state of no-mind.
And after spiritual awakening no one in this world asks , now what? Your consciousness guides you like a torch on your path in the darkness.
Spiritual awakening dissolves all your questions and the ultimate ANSWER finds you.
Because we all are born with question mark in our heart and spiritual awakening gives THE ANSWER to that question mark."
Osho said he was poisoned in his previous birth while fasting. How could someone give you poison when you are not taking any food or water?,"God, reincarnation,soul and Nirvana/moksha are framework to reach state of superconsciousness where person live without being slave to mind.
Mind doesn't understand direct language so we have to create metaphors and stories.
Osho was never poisoned 700 years ago.This is a story to reinforce the importance of Nirvana/ Moksha/liberation.
Enlightenment is a state of mind where you live in bliss but it is still a state where mind is used on demand.
Normally mind is observer but in enlightenment mind is observed by consciousness."
What led to the downfall of Osho?,"There were three reasons for downfall of Osho :-
Land deal by Ma Sheela without knowing the construction laws of the land in Oregon.
Enlightenment is very rare and very individual phenomena. It can't be sold in wholesale.
Ronald Reagan and all bureaucrats were trying to solve political problem by criminal justice system.
But remember nothing happens without reason and trust me nothing happens in this world without reason.
Whatever happened in Oregon will never happen again in next thousands of years and ultimately people will know the beauty of the experiment Osho tried in Oregon to raise human consciousness."
What is enlightenment? Do fake men and saints claim enlightenment to entice followers?,"There can be no smoke without fire. Enlightenment is state of No-mind called samadhi.
Those who self-realised are called Gods.
Lord Shiva awakened his kundalini- path of tantra to self-realisation (enlightenment).
Enlightenment is all about awakening kundalini (all seven chakras).
Lord Krishna showed the path of love and devotion to self-realisation. e.g. Meera.
Buddha showed the path of mind- doubts and logic to self-realisation.
It is not easy to find enlightened person and finding enlightened master is next to impossible.
Enlightenment is real thing but Gurus and saints misuse it for their financial advantage.
Enlightenment is all about going beyond mind. Enlightenment is your true nature."
"Why a would a normal person (not a yogi) require a guru, when s/he could take guidance from her/his own conscience?","Conscience is based on morals and immorals set out by society and society is always interested to make you useful for society. Society, priests or politicians are not interested in individuals. They need herd of perfect sheeps to rule.
They want you to die for religion. They want you to die for nation. They even create education system to make you a member of stupid herd. They want to rule your inner and outer world.
Conscience is utterly blind. But consciousness is not moral or immoral , consciousness is amoral.
But normally we spend all our life in mind and mind is master and already corrupted by the society.
You need Guru who can understand your mind and lead you to state of no-mind.
Guru is someone who can activate your soul and clear up your consciousness of mind."
How does our PAST give our ego an identity and how does our ego present the future as salvation?,"Past and future are dreams. Only present is reality. Past and future are fuel for ego. Past is list of the achievements and future is the list of goals. Achievements are manifested desires and goals are longing desires.
And these desires come out of mind. Mind is function of ego. Only your present is egoless.
More you live here and now as witness lesser your ego (mind) will affect your future."
Will some people obtain enlightenment due to the coronavirus?,"Many people will experience spiritual awakening because of covid-19. The reason for this is experience of death. Many people will find futility of life in the shadow of death.
Only experience (not fear of death) of death causes spiritual awakening. When one experiences death in the presence of love something dies inside and the transformation starts to happen.
Death of loved one or the thought of death of loved one carries current of transformation.
Death in presence of love makes one to seek inward and once the spiritual awakening starts there is no stopping. Starting is the key and it happens with death of loved one or thought of death of loved one."
How do you get through the Dark Night of the Soul? How long does it usually last?,"The dark night of the soul is a Christian term we have equivalent in tantra i.e. Anahata (heart) chakra.
All spiritual awakenings require awakening of kundalini. But sometimes passage is so clear that it is not noticed like in case of Buddha and mahavira. Buddha and Mahavira never talked about Kundalini but the reason is they had the kundalini passage very clear.
You tend to stuck at heart chakra because of your suppressed emotions from your childhood or because of Complex post traumatic stress disorder (Complex-PTSD).
Because of (Complex-PTSD) you tend to lose sense of your being (body), you move like zombie for months or maybe years. From here to there is no turning back sooner or latter you are going to transcend to fifth chakra (Vishuddha chakra) also called throat chakra or in some cases you can transcend directly to Sahasara chakra (seventh chakra) including awakening of third eye ( agya chakra).
Once kundalini rises to Sahasara chakra your permanent awakening is complete. You will never fall back to normal mind.
Now you will live life of no-mind. Mind will be your servent you can choose to call it for use or you can also choose not to call it."
"Sometimes, suddenly my heart beats faster and I'm getting scared for no reason. What should I do?","There is a problem with your Manipura chakra. Your confidence and digest system are affected because of manipura chakra.
How to solve it.
Let's do it right way :-
Lie down comfortably somewhere and put your left hand palm on your heart and right palm on your forehead and breath consciously till you feel your energy flowing from your heart to forehead. This will take energy from your heart to head.
After that just remove hands from heart and head and disperse energy to your ears by listening to surrounding sounds. This will relax your heart and head.
Do it every time your heart beats fast."
Can we stay spiritual from the inside by connecting with external society?,"Spirituality is not about duality. You are still stuck in duality. Duality is very nature of mind.
Spirituality is all about transcending duality of mind and meeting the supreme source we call God.
Once you start your journey inward . This question will become irrelevant."
Can the coronavirus also affect an enlightened person?,"Enlightened persons are physically weak. There is major changes in body of enlightened.
Normally the energy we get from food ( food is produced by the energy of sun) follows downward to sex centre (Hara chakra) because of gravitation of earth.
In enlightened person energy travels upward to sahasara chakra (head) because of gravitation of moon.
His energy system becomes Unnatural. Moreover he forgets sense of his being frequently because of absence of mind.
Most of enlightened persons die young because of serious aliment like cancer e.g. Ramana Maharshi and swami Vivekananda.
Enlightened person is more prone to any infection because of food habits.
Being enlightened is no fun."
Can we go into our past lives to know who we were using hypnotherapy? How further can we go?,"All our memories we store in our unconscious mind. With the help of hypnosis , you enter your unconscious deeper and deeper. Once you enter unconscious mind you can be directed by hypnotist to choose your previous birth and retrieve the information of the birth. You can go upto 7 births."
How do I increase my memory power?,"Edward De Bono has done great work in the field of thinking - following are books you will find helpful in strengthening your mind :-
How to have a beautiful mind.
Six thinking Hats
Lateral thinking
I personally love the book - Six Thinking Hats.
If you master the book - Six Thinking Hats . Your mind will evolve exponentially."
Why do most people choose harmful substances over meditation to calm their minds?,"When mind is master and our body is slave. Mind always tries to find solution of the problem outside. Whereas mind also creates artificial problems and then mind tries to find solution outside. Mind (ego) has tendency of indulgence. Mind indulges in all kind of things ranging from praying to raping or killing because body has to follow mind and mind knows language of indulgence (desires). Mind is master when it is observer.
Meditation is something mind is afraid of. Opposite of mind is meditation.But when spiritual seeking starts then one redirects mind inward automatically. When inner journey starts then one doesn't need drugs or alcohol."
Are vegans good to progress in meditation?,"Vegan food is good for meditation. With sattvic food results are achieved faster.
Eating non-veg food is counter-productive. Because spiritual awakening is process of purifying your consciousness. It is upgradation of your consciousness.
Idea of killing someone just doesn't go with spiritual awakening and forget about eating dead body, if you are on the path of spiritual awakening."
Why does a Yogi's eye move upward in Ajna Chakra?,"There are seven chakras in our subtle body. First five represent water because water flows downward.
Sixth chakra (Ajna chakra/third eye) represents fire and fire always rises upwards. That is why Yogi's eyes move upward for ajna chakra."
Is it true that Samadhi can only be achieved after crossing Sahasrara Chakra by our Kundalini Shakti?,"Sahasara chakra is 7th chakra and samadhi is attained by awakening sahasara chakra.
Samadhi is state of no-mind. Only sahasara chakra doesn't have sleep mode it is always awakened collecting sensory information 24x7. This is why state of Samadhi. This information is provided to third eye for further processing.All other chakras have sleep and awaken state.
To be in samadhi - state of No-mind sahasara chakra should awakened."
Have you ever opened your third eye? Did it hurt? What were the benefits or costs of becoming enlightened?,"When the 6th chakra (agya chakra) is awakened. It is also called third eye. Third eye is an organ pineal gland in physical body and it works in astral body.
it is not possible to awaken ajna chakra directly without opening at least following chakras:-
Muladhar chakra
Hara chakra
Heart (anahata) chakra
After these three chakra you can awaken ajna chakra.
It is painful to leave Hara chakra and entering heart chakra.
When agya chakra( third eye) is activated then energy is withdrawn from two eyes redirecting that energy to pineal gland.
Other two eyes get fixed and blinking of eyelids becomes rare ( see the eyes of OSHO ). Pineal gland can't be damaged but because of withdrawal of energy from two eyes can cause blindness.
Agya chakra is most sensitive and dangerous to deal with."
Is Kundalini awakening a pre-requisite to attain moksha?,"Kundalini awakening is part of the moksha/enlightenment not pre-requisite. There are mainly three methods to attain moksha - enlightenment.
Shiva Tantra yoga - this is the path where kundalini awakening is pre-requisite to attain moksha. Moksha is attained by awakening kundalini.
Krishna -The path of Heart - here love and devotion is the key to enlightenment . You know the case of Meera. She attained moksha on the path of heart. Kundalini awakening is a by-product in the path of heart.
Buddha - The path of mind - this is most difficult path. Here one has to approach through mind. All the efforts are to be witness of mind. Kundalini awakening is a by-product.
All paths lead to self-realisation. In tantra it is through physical body. In krishna's path it is heart - emotions and devotion. In buddha' s path it is mind that is approached to attain enlightenment."
Why does Osho blink his eyes very less? Is it a sign of enlightenment?,"When enlightenment happens in that kundalini is also awakened. There are 7 chakras (energy centre) in subtle body. There is exponential rush of kundalini energy upward to sahasara chakra. Kundalini energy (shakti) rushes to the 6th chakra (agya chakra) and it is awakened.
Agya chakra is also called third eye. Third eye is an organ in physical body called pineal gland.When agya chakra( third eye) is activated then energy is withdrawn from two eyes and also redirecting that energy to pineal gland.
Other two eyes get fixed and blinking of eyelids becomes rare (see the eyes of OSHO in videos).
All enlightened people rarely blink eyes and their eyes will have hypnotic effects. If you happen to look right in their eyes you will feel the love and devotion automatically."
Is it possible to damage your third eye?,"Third eye is an organ in physical body called pineal gland.When agya chakra( third eye) is activated then energy is withdrawn from two eyes redirecting that energy to pineal gland.
Other two eyes get fixed and blinking of eyelids becomes rare ( see the eyes of OSHO ). Pineal gland can't be damaged but because of withdrawal of energy from two eyes can cause blindness.
Agya chakra is most sensitive and dangerous to deal with."
Has spirituality been made a business in modern times?,"Spirituality is a multi-million dollars industry. Even yoga is a multi-billion dollars industry.
It has become industry because we don't understand that spirituality is an individual’s quest for true-self.
It is so individual that it varies not person to person , it also varies with time.
People are sad, frustrated, frightened and looking out for magical pill. Mind has tendency to find solution to problems outside. While all the solutions are available inside of an individual.
Mind creates unnecessary artificial problem and then try to find solution outside. Some find alcohol and drugs as solution.
Some go to seek father figure. When they find one spiritual supermarket , one gets stuck , buying anything and everything.
Spiritual supermarket becomes richer and richer.
Nothing will change in near future. These shops will increase as people will become more sad, frustrated and frightened."
Do lower IQ people get enlightened?,"Yes , of course , everybody is born enlightened but society makes him unenlightened.
Enlightenment is our true nature. There are many path to enlightenment. Major two are path of heart and path of mind.
Krishna’s path is path of devotion/heart.
Buddha’s path is path of mind.
Path of mind requires high IQ.
Parh of heart just requires heart full of love and devotion. Meera is a good example.
Both the path leads to one destination- self-realisation."
Does kundalini awakening cause skin problems?,"Kundalini awakening does cause skin problems. I know three places where skin problems can occur.
When kundalini arises from muladhar chakra to Hara chakra you will have lot of skin rashes inside your thighs like some fungus infection.
Second when you enter vishuddha (throat) chakra , your mouth and throat will become soft and you won't be able to drink alcohol or eat spicy food.
When the third eye (agya chakra) is opened you will have many spots between your eyebrows.
Hardest part is anahata ( heart) chakra, because we have very strong emotions. If you are stuck in heart chakra you will move like zombie for years and you will have frequent surge in heartbeats upto 170 BPM. Here only enlightened master can help you. This state is also called , “The dark night of the soul”."
Which yogasana can increase growth hormone?,"Yogasanas can't really be helpful in increasing Human Growth Hormones. Either you need to inject them directly doing HGH full cycle ( that's what all actors and actresses do)
or
You have to do weight training and doing following excercises :-
Squat
Deadlifts
Farmer's walk
Lift heavy your HGH will skyrocket in a month."
Can meditation develop immunity against COVID-19 (coronavirus)?,"You are asking this question out of fear. Meditation has nothing to do with immunity.
Meditation is to silence the mind. Covid-19 is a biological virus problem. Meditation can give you courage to fight against the fear you have of death . Your fear is not of covid-19. Your fear is of death.
Relax when death happens it happens nobody can stop it.
Follow the instructions given by the government and be alert.
Nobody can eradicate fear. Fear is one of the basic mechanisms of body. Fear helps you to be alert. Fear can only be understood."
What did Buddha see during his enlightenment?,"Read :-
Sidharth by Hermann Hesse"
Which is the best Ashram to learn meditation in Rishikesh?,"You don't have to go anywhere. Meditation is not something you do. Meditation is a state of non-doing.
When you meditate, there will be gaps between two thoughts and as you keep doing meditation for years the gaps will become larger and larger and one day that gap will become permanent i.e. state of no-mind — samadhi.
In state of No-mind all your chakras will open altogether or one by one.
Our ultimate goal is to be witness ,so witnessing is best meditation.
Go to park before dawn (Twilight) and close your eyes and just listen to sounds of birds, wind. Just be conscious and be witness.
Initially observer will be mind and one day observer will be observed by consciousness.
That will be state of No-mind - samadhi.
PS :- Do comment for more information. I shall try to give you accurate information"
"If enlightenment is here and now, why don't I feel or experience it? Why do I still not see the world through enlightened eyes?","Enlightenment is the work of many lives it is never here and now. It requires intense inner work.
When it is said - Enlightenment is here and now. It is a device to start your journey because if I say it is very far, you might not be able to attain it in this life then your search will not start.
You will deny the very possibility of it and that is how the mind is. Mind wants everything now and here yet remains entangled in past and future.This is the paradox of the mind.
If enlightenment is here and now then also you will deny its possibility your ego will be nourished. Your ego will find abode in the comfort of not searching.
So I have to use mix of paradoxes. But the truth is :-
Enlightenment is millions of light years away from you.
You have to earn it."
What is the difference between samadhi and enlightenment?,"Samadhi is state of no-mind (turiya* -fourth state). Before enlightenment one experiences satori (glimpses of state no-mind) by awakening kundalini unconsciously.
After satori one falls back to normal state of mind. Then again kundalini starts awakening consciously by awakening chakras one by one.
There are three states of mind west knows about :-
Waking, dreaming and deep sleep.East knows about fourth state called turiya - this state has qualities of dreaming and waking.
*Turiya means fourth."
Do any enlightened beings have spirit guides?,"Enlightened beings don't have spirit guides. As they have become master of his mind ,they don't need guides outside of him.
Enlightened beings do have mastermind group.
There are many esoteric groups from the time of Buddha. Each esoteric group has 9 members in inner circle. When one of them dies then they replace his position by new one by mutual consent."
How can I cleanse and illuminate my aura and personality? I really need something substantial and worth working.,"Awakening of kundalini gives you magnetic aura everything else is just mind games.
Everything else you read or do to illuminate your aura is just theories to manipulate other's mind artificially.
With kundalini awakening you will have aura and voice of goddess.
It takes time and patience. There is no shortcuts to real thing."
What is the most barbaric side of the mind?,"Barbaric side of mind is tendency to find questions in answer and then finding answer to new question. Mind creates loop of questions and answers and wasting tremendous amount of energy in the process.
This is why sages say, “Mind is a monkey”."
Is Dhyana a kind of deep sleep?,"Q. What is dhyana?
Ans. When you meditate there will be gaps between two thoughts and as you keep doing meditation for years the gaps will become larger and larger and one day that gap will become permanent i.e. state of no-mind — samadhi.
In state of No-mind all your chakras will open altogether or one by one causing spiritual awakening.
Our ultimate goal is to be witness ,so witnessing is best meditation.
Go to park before dawn (Twilight) and close your eyes and just listen to sounds of birds, wind. Just be conscious and be witness.
Initially observer will be mind and one day observer will be observed by consciousness.
That will be state of No-mind - samadhi."
What are the higher chakras?,"There are 8 chakras - first five chakras symbolise water and 6th, 7th (a) and 7(b) symbolise fire , so 6th, 7th (a) and 7(b) are higher chakras."
How can I stop a spiritual awakening?,"Spiritual awakening can be blocked depending on which layer of your ego you are at
There are layers of ego. When spiritual awakening happens all the layers are peeled like peeling an onion:-
———————first layer--------------------
Some people live in social layer - they meet people and say hi , but they don't mean it. They goto funeral they cry but their tears are false. They lead artificial life.
------------second layer-----------------
I am president of America. I am monitor of the class. They remain comfortable being someone.
------------Chaos--------------------
Introvert/emotional people fall to this layer if something bad happens to them like breakup or death of loved one. They become alcoholic or drugs addicts or they waste considerable energy in thinking and they remain mad. This is the reason people in this layer can't concentrate and because of excessive thinking their health deteriorates.
(If you are here in this layer- spiritual awakening can be blocked).
———————Death—.————
If you enter death layer then it is very difficult to block spiritual awakening almost impossible.
In this layer you need master to transcend to next layer , without master you move like ZOMBIE / next layer is LIFE , your ego dies and you are born again ( this happens on new moon night or full moon night) here only enlightened master can help / NEXT layer is BLISS in this you acquire new compassionate ego formation ( to reach this stage master can't help) this is where you can be Epicurous or Buddha , both possibilities are beautiful.
Once you form new compassionate ego, your spiritual awakening is complete."
Is full focus breathing possible in the real world?,"Yes , enlightened being is aware of all five+1 senses and he never sleeps.
That is why krishna said in gita:-
Yogi never sleeps."
What is the method to awake kundalini?,"SHAKTIPAT by enlightened master is quickest way to experience kundalini awakening.
Master will just touch your head or any one of the 7 chakras , you will experience bliss instantly."
Is clairvoyance part of the sixth sense?,"Clairvoyance - the supposed faculty of perceiving things or events in the future or beyond normal sensory contact.
Sixth chakra (agya chakra) works in conjunction with sahasara chakra. Sahasara chakra doesn't have sleeping state. All other chakras have sleeping and awake state.
Sahasara chakra doesn't sleep and keeps collecting sensory information and then that information is provided to agya chakra and then the third eye processes information to predict future events called intuition."
What is the difference between Kundalini and chakras? Are both same or different?,"Kundalini is serpent like energy resting dormant at base of the spine and chakras are energy Centres in your subtle body.
Shakti is kundalini energy which travels upward to 7th chakra called sahasara to meet shiva.
All the energy we get in our body is acquired from sun, the food we eat also comes from sun only.
The energy that we get from food is pulled downward by earth gravitation. So energy moves downward normally.
When one attains state of no-mind. Same energy starts travelling upward through chakras because of gravitation pull of moon.
Our energy becomes sensitive to gravitation of moon.
At base of spine is muladhar chakra (earth chakra) and at top 7th chakra (sahasara chakra is moon chakra)."
What are the physical changes in brain after enlightenment?,"There are subtle changes in body that anybody who is enlightened can list them :-
Muladhar chakra keeps viberating because of earth rotation.
Hara chakra doesn't stimulate sex.
Vishuddhi chakra softens your throat , tongue and mouth that results in change of voice.
Ajna chakra (third eye/pineal gland) takes most of the energy of two eyes making two eyes fixed and there is hardly any blinking of eyelids.
Vision becomes 3D - holographic and eyesight is enhanced by 200% or more. One can see literally inside moon.
Bindu chakra keeps sending rings of energy upwards towards moon because of moon's gravitation.
There is strong effects of lunar phases specially of full moon."
"I deteriorated physically and I am doing very badly in the studies despite studying, I suspect that I am under witchcraft. How do I get rid of this witchcraft?","There are stages in everybody' s life . Let us study them :-
———————first layer--------------------
Some people live in social layer - they meet people and say hi , but they don't mean it. They goto funeral they cry but their tears are false. They lead artificial life.
------------second layer-----------------
I am president of America. I am monitor of the class. They remain comfortable being someone.
------------Chaos--------------------
Introvert/emotional people fall to this layer if something bad happens to them like breakup or death of loved one. They become alcoholic or drugs addicts or they waste considerable energy in thinking and they remain mad. This is the reason people in this layer can't concentrate and because of excessive thinking their health deteriorates.
(You are here in this layer)
Your Manipura chakra is imbalanced that is why your health is deteriorating and your concentration is wavering.
Just remain aware of your mind and body. you will be alright in 20–30 days.
Meditate if possible."
"Through the power of meditation, can someone control matter?","With meditation you can attain state of no-mind- samadhi. In state of no-mind you will awaken your kundalini- you will awaken all 8 chakras.
With every chakra opening you will have supernatural powers.
With 4th chakra awakening you will have reiki touch , you can heal physical pains and chakra healing like Jesus.
With 5th chakra you will have fiery speech (almost God like voice).
With sixth chakra (third eye) you will have strong intuition and fiery eyes ( anyone looking in your eyes will be hypnotized)
With 7th chakra (sahasara) you will become avtar of God.
With 8th chakra awakening you will be like God is walking on the earth. (You will attain moksha/Nirvana)
After 8th chakra awakening, you will add more and more supernatural powers everyday.
Like astral projection, out of body experience and flying in air, walking on water anything, it all depends on your exploration."
How do the monks/Aghoris/priests suppress their urge to 'please' themselves?,"I can tell you about monks and aghoris but priests are most artificially intelligent creatures on earth.
Monks who have attained state of no-mind.
When no-mind is attained the sex energy starts to move upward , normally energy is moved downward to sex centre. That is why sex has such a divine pleasure for normal person. He thinks about sex every few minutes. But when energy starts to move upward then sex becomes unnecessary.
Aghoris are kind of tantric. They live death everyday though death of other. They eat dead bodies of humans (partially roasted , Ha ha ha) . That kind of people can't think of sex. They have transcended death."
How do you learn to read chakras?,"There are mainly 4 vital chakras, which are in subtle body :-
Muladhar chakra
Hara chakra
Heart (anahata) chakra
Ajna chakra (third eye)
If you are manage to open these four chakras , rest chakras will awaken automatically."
Is it possible to open the Ajna chakra without opening any other chakras?,"No, it is not possible to awaken ajna chakra without opening at least following chakras:-
Muladhar chakra
Hara chakra
Heart (anahata) chakra
After these three chakra you can awaken ajna chakra."
What is the complete knowledge of 7 chakras?,"There are 7 chakras in subtle body. Most of the people try to find/experience chakras through mind.
Through mind one can only imagine things. Mind is master of human body like in case of animals.
But only humans have capacity to transcend mind and attain state of no-mind.
Knowledge about chakras can be acquired from books. But that would be business of mind only.
Q. How can one awaken chakras?
Ans. Mind has to be trained to acknowledge the emptiness of our being by meditation.
When we meditate there are gaps between two thoughts like we have gaps between two words when we speak.
That gaps between two thoughts become larger and larger and one fine day that gap comes and never goes away, that is called state of No-mind - samadhi.
When samadhi occurs all your chakras are opened and kundalini is awakened.
Once the samadhi is attained then you will start experiencing chakras directly without mind.
Your bookish knowledge will start making sense and you will be spiritually awakened.
Simplified route to kundalini/chakras is meditation.
Q. How to do meditation?
Ans. Meditation should never be done after meal or in the night ( meditation works like tranquilizer at night).
Go to park before dawn (Twilight) or dusk(Twilight) and find a calm place and sit down in any pose , close your eyes and start to listen to sounds of birds. Just observe without any choice (choiceless choice).
20–25 minutes are enough.
Ques. Why to meditate in dawn or dusk?
Ans. There is a light but source of light is yet to come or source of light is gone in case of dusk.
Hindu call it sandhya.
Here is better map: - you meditate in dawn and you pray in dusk (sandhya)."
Why am I feeling so distracted? I'm not feeling happy as I was after my awakening six months before. What's wrong with me? Even not feeling able to do or manifest what I'm awaken for. Plz help.,"Your Awakening is not complete. You have stuck somewhere at anahata chakra (heart chakra). This is called death phase.
In death phase one moves like zombie for years.
Your ego has died and you need enlightened master to give birth to your new loving, compassionate ego- new life phase. After new life phase you can move to bliss phase to become either Epicurean or Buddha.
You just need a touch of a Enlightened master at your head.You will pass through death phase in seconds.
Update: This is also called -“the dark night of the soul”.
PS : go through my post about the- dark night of the soul."
What is the basic difference between yoga of Shilpa Shetty and yoga of Baba Ramdev?,"Both are more like aerobics or stretching excercise.
True meaning of yoga is to attain self-realization.
Neither of two attained anything spiritually.
Both are after money and fame."
What are the ways to know about our previous lives?,"Are you ready to die?
All our past lives are stored in unconscious mind.
In your deep meditation if you are able to touch your unconscious mind , you can know all your past lives.
This can be scary. This may cause serious heart problems or nervous breakdown.
This experiment should be done under supervision of Enlightened master or hypnotherapist."
How do you know that enlightenment is permanent?,"Enlightenment is not something one can miss noticing , I am not talking about Enlightened being. I am talking about people around enlightened being. Even people around enlightened being will notice the presence of him - like God is walking on earth.
Though before Enlightenment you will experience satori (glimpse of No-mind) many times.
But on very special day like on new moon(amavasya) or full moon (purnima) you will attain state of No-mind, you will become witness. Your mind will not be observer, your consciousness will be observer of this world and mind inclusive.
This world will not be Maya anymore.
If enlightenment comes with upgradation of consciousness then it will stay forever.
Otherwise one may lose it because of negative emotions like anger,lust or greed.
Enlightenment knows two thing only LOVE AND AWARENESS."
"Everyone says our mind should be blank during meditation but nobody tells us how to do it, what is the best way to do it?","When you meditate, there will be gaps between two thoughts and as you keep doing meditation for years the gaps will become larger and larger and one day that gap will become permanent i.e. state of no-mind — samadhi.
In state of No-mind all your chakras will open altogether or one by one.
Our ultimate goal is to be witness ,so witnessing is best meditation.
Go to park before dawn (Twilight) and close your eyes and just listen to sounds of birds, wind. Just be conscious and be witness.
Initially observer will be mind and one day observer will be observed by consciousness.
That will be state of No-mind - samadhi.
PS :- Do comment for more information. I shall try to give you accurate information"
What are the steps one should take at the beginning to go towards the enquiry of the Real Self along with reading spiritual scriptures and teachings of Enlightened Masters?,"Meditation is the only thing you will ever need and witnessing is the quickest tool to Enlightenment.
Enlightenment actually means witnessing. When one becomes Enlightened , he becomes witness of this world and mind inclusive.
So witnessing is the key."
"How can you get enlightenment through meditation? Because meditation effect is not permanent, does it mean my enlightenment will go away too?","When you do meditation there will be gaps between two thoughts and as you keep doing meditation for years the gaps will become larger and larger and one day that gap will become permanent i.e. state of no-mind — samadhi.
In state of No-mind all your chakras will open altogether or one by one.
PS :- Do comment for more information. I shall try to give you accurate information."
"When should we do third eye meditation, before or after trataka? Should we wash our eyes after doing it?","When you do meditation there will be gaps between two thoughts and as you keep doing meditation for years the gaps will become larger and larger and one day that gap will become permanent i.e. state of no-mind — samadhi.
In state of No-mind all your chakras will open altogether or one by one.
PS :- Do comment for more information. I shall try to give you accurate information."
What is the technique to know if my third eye is open?,"No one can open third eye ( sixth chakra/agya chakra and corresponding physical organ in body is pineal gland ) drectly. You need to activate at least following chakras to activate third eye:-
Muladhara chakra
Hara (sacral) chakra
Anahata (Heart) chakra
Agya chakra (third eye/sixth chakra)
If Agya chakra is activated then your eyesight will increase considerablely. You will have fire in your eyes. Your intuition will be extraordinary (it is sixth chakra that is why it is related to sixth sense - intuition).
Your world will be holographic. You will not be slave of your body(habits). You will become master of your faculty.
For more info please leave comment I shall try to answer accurately."
Does doing meditation on a regular basis enhance the sixth sense?,"Sixth sense is related to third eye (agya chakra) untill and unless one awakens sixth chakra(agya chakra) nothing will enhance sixth sense.
You can't activate third eye directly. To activate third eye you need to awaken following chakras :-
Muldhara chakra
Hara chakra
Heart chakra
Third eye (agya chakra)
Meditation will be helpful but not all you will need to enhance sixth sense."
"Does any one living being achieve one of four stages (sotapanna, sakadagami, anagami and arahant) in Vipassana on Earth?","I have attained (sorry to use this word because of the language limitations) arahat.
Arahat means the state where one who has all 7+ chakras awakened.
But I used combination of Vipassana and witnessing and I found witnessing more practical and easy. But combination of both the meditation is dynamite."
"What's the best meditation technique for someone with accidental awakened kundalini with a very dynamic energy, something that keeps them grounded?","You should start doing witnessing of your five senses at dawn and dusk for 20–24 minutes everyday.
It is better you go to some beautiful place like park, river bank, mountain or some big temple. I prefer to go to park.
You can also do chakras sound meditation using earphones of good quality (keep the sound low for first 5 chakras and high for sixth (third eye) chakra and seventh chakra -sahasara chakra ."
What are Osho's views on education?,"Once Osho met Jawaharlal Nehru and he asked Jawaharlal Nehru to include his work in university course syllabus.
After reading his views on the education and the rebellious nature of the views about education. Jawaharlal Nehru rejected his idea to include his work in curriculum of colleges.
His views was in favour of freedom of the individuals. Freedom from political and religious control.
You will get the good idea about osho's views on education-- just read the book “ priest and politicians- the mafia of the soul” by Osho."
What do you think can happen if Osho is born in this time?,"Osho is here and now. He was talking of this time only. People misunderstood him , because he belonged to us only. Accidentally he was born on 11th December 1931.
He is for us not for Poona or Oregon,USA 1970’s or 80’s. He is with us right here and now.
Listen to him read him and feel him here and now."
"During meditation, when I try to focus on my breath, why does my body start deep breathing consciously?","This means you are about to experience silence of death. Meditation is penetrating your calm centre where first time you will be alone without anybody.
Our centre is calm there is pin drop silence, when one experiences silence of death then breathing automatically changes like in fear and anger.
Don't stop keep doing it. It will be death of ego not the physical death of your body."
Does the path of self-enquiry require courage?,"Everybody is born seeker. The reason for that is emptiness of your being. We are born empty. Then the tendency to fill the emptiness turns into seeking. Seeking is inherent quality of human.
Seeking has three dimensions one is quantity, quality and spiritual.
On physical plane one seeks by accumulating more cars, bigger houses, more girls, more educational degrees,more gold. This is quantitative.
Second dimension is qualitative. This is also on physical plane more expensive car, more beautiful girl, highest degree.
Third dimension is spiritual . When one is fad up of material world the seeking turns inward and here try is to calm down the race of material world and finding peace without objects and subjects.
You don't need courage for self-enquiry. Seeking is your very nature. You just have to turn inward and rest will happen automatically."
Do we exist in the mind of God?,"Yes we are loving inside cosmic consciousness. You call it God, source, creator. Your consciousness is part of cosmic consciousness."
What changes have come in society due to Osho?,"Osho was never concerned with family,society or nation. His whole philosophy is concerned about individuals.
Families, societies and nations are names of collectivties.
For moksha, liberation one has to travel alone. The joy of liberation only individual can understand.
If you read/hear Osho you will feel the vairaag. You will automatically fall into abyss of emptiness.
Emptiness is our reality and that is why we keep asking for more. More money,more cars,more education degree, more sex.
Most of us start journey outward and some start journey inside.
Those who start journey inside understand emptiness."
"Corona is mentioned as Wuhan 400 on page number 353 of the book ""The Eyes of Darkness"". How true is this?","There is no 353 page in that book. Yes there is mention of Wuhan 400 , but that is some rays not virus. It is work of fiction not some facts."
How can we dry hash fast?,By professional dehydrater. You can buy it on Amazon.
How does it feel after your third eye is opened?,"To open your third eye you will have to shake away your last hook of the illusionary world - you will have to kill your God. Third eye is seat of your God.
Until you kill your attachment to your God your third eye (Agya Chakra) will not open. God is the subtlest hook of Maya ( illusion). It is the hardest thing to do in the path of kundalini. That is why the opening of the third eye is so rare.
The day you detach yourself from the concept of God your conscious mind will drop and the sensory system gets connected to the subconscious mind.
How does it feel after your third eye is opened?
When your third eye is opened then this world looks clearer and more colourful (super HD) and nuke 3D because the third eye gives more depth and non-duality to the vision. The third eye also helps you see miles away as compared to ordinary eyes.
Why does the third eye give almost infallible intuition?
With the opening of the third eye, the sensory system works directly with the subconscious mind and the duality of mind drops so as the fiction part of the mind as words and language of the conscious mind is bypassed and every thought and vision is crystal clear.
Opening of the third eye almost gives you latent powers like no-mind and silence of this very existence.

Is there any scientific proof of the existence of chakras?,"Science knows how to dissect body and after dissection of body the body wil not remain same. If you try to find chakras you will never find. There is subtle difference in live body and dead body.
It is like trying to see through ears or trying to hear from your eyes.
Chakras can be felt in body with little efforts.
Sixth chakra (agya chakra) is also called third eye and the corresponding body organ is pineal gland.
Chakras are part of energy body. Chakras can be experienced when you attain from mind to no-mind state.
When your energy starts rising upward and pulled by gravitation of moon.
Normally our energy is pulled downward by the gravitation of earth.
There are 9 chakras three agya, sahasara (a) and sahasara (b) represent fire rest six represent water.
Generally you will reach sahasara on full moon night or 6th day of new moon night.
All chakras except sahasrara have sleep and awaken states and sahasara chakra has only awaken state and works 24x7.
That is why Krishna said yogi never sleeps.
Chakra are not part of physical body they are part of subtle body but they have corresponding points in physical body.
There is nothing spiritual about kundalini.
Kundalini is symbolic but it is very scientific phenomena exists in every living being but only humans have abilities to acknowledge that and make use of it."
Roughly how many enlightened people are living on the planet in 2018?,"Somewhere around 10000. Enlightened people don't live longer life.
Being enlightened is against nature. As our energy is under influence of gravitation pull of earth.
When one becomes enlightened - his energy is influenced by the gravitational pull of moon. His energy starts to move upwards.
Now because energy is pulled by moon , he starts to experience 8 chakras - last chakra is sahasara. Sahasara chakra never sleeps , it remains in awaken state 24x7.
Due to this enlightened person never sleeps. He becomes weak and hence his life is reduced by 1/3.
Being enlightened is like living life of a fragile man. Enlightened person is even weaker than woman of same age. His sensitivity to five senses increases upto 500%. Now this is not boon, it is hell.
If enlightenment happens before the age of 35 , then body can take the shock bit easily. But after 40 , if the body is not very very strong , he will die very soon , maybe just after enlightenment- that is why we call it Nirvana.
And there is nothing spiritual about Enlightenment.
It is a trick to bypass the mind."
Why did the Buddha say that societies give birth to dust? What is wrong with society according to him? He almost sounds like a misanthrope here.,"Society, nation , family- these are name of collectivties. Buddha was interested in growth of individuals.
Society creates herd of people , which are useful to society. Society creates atmosphere of ambitions. Hence people have ego which enjoys challenges, puzzles, riddles.
Mind , full of ambitions and desires can't be calm hence we have all kind of neurosis. This world has become madhouse.
Society defines morals and immorals,limiting possibility of growth of an individual.
Societies, politicians, priests are interested in controlling people to exploit them for power and money. You become prisoner of ideas and thoughts.
Die for religion, die for nation.
Take it from me , nobody is interested in your growth. Everybody is there for himself.
Don't die for nation. Don't die for religion. Die for yourself.
Hence, Buddha said, societies give birth to dust."
"For two years, I have been in spiritual awakening and truth-seeking path. For the past few months, nothing interests me anymore. I am neglecting my worldly affairs and sitting still doing nothing. Why is this happening?","There are layers of conditioning and when those layers are peeled, you come closer to spiritual awakening.
First layer is social layer, second is ego e.g. i am president, i am judge/ chaos - something happens bad like death of kid, divorce - you fall to chaos /next is death stage (this is where you are) in this layer you need master to transcend to next layer , without master you move like zombie (that's what you are at present)/ next layer is LIFE , your ego dies and you are born again ( this happens on new moon day) here only enlightened master can help / NEXT layer is BLISS in this you acquire new compassionate ego formation ( to reach this stage master can't help) this is where you can be Epicurous or Buddha , both possibilities are beautiful.
Your spiritual awakening is complete."
"Who are you? Answer without name, job, culture, things you did, and friends.",I am pure consciousness.
"Why is Ramana Maharshi less popular (even in Tamil Nadu) than many of the gurus of his time, even though his teachings seem more advanced?","Ramana maharishi was very simple being. Any hypocrite can't accept Ramana maharishi as enlightened being. Because mind always search for complexity. Mind enjoys challenges,puzzles, riddles. Mind is ego. People who are always in mind can't understand him.
Only people who live life by heart can understand Ramana Maharshi. Unfortunately there are very few people who live their life by heart.
There are three gunas of which one uses to express his message. Tamas - cause of inactivity, inertia /Rajas - cause of activities, passion /sattwa - cause of serenity,calmness.
Rajas was predominant medium of expression for Mohammad and jesus and tamas was predominant medium of expression for Lao Tzu and Sri Ramana maharishi.
He expressed his silence and emptiness by his gunas of tamas so it was felt not said in words."
What made Sri Ramana Maharshi so popular? What is his message to the whole world?,"There are three gunas of which one uses to express his message. Tamas - cause of inactivity, inertia /Rajas - cause of activities, passion /sattwa - cause of serenity,calmness.
Rajas was predominant medium of expression for Mohammad and jesus and tamas was predominant medium of expression for Lao Tzu and Sri Ramana maharishi.
He expressed his silence and emptiness by his gunas of tamas so it was felt not said in words.
He expressed his serenity in doing simple things like cutting vegetables , carrying water bucket.
His calmness was expressed by using tamas gunas and it was so simple to feel the calmness.
His simplicity was reason for his popularity."
"Could you tell me more about my clear vision and not blinking? Since my awakening, you are the only person I've found who has been correct about why.","Your third eye (pineal gland) is activated now you have got the freedom from desires of your body.
You have activated your both left and right brain. Now your wisdom will increase exponentially.
Your sixth chakra (agya chakra) has opened and this is the reason for clear vision.
Not blinking the eyes is because you have reached state of No-mind. That means your sahasara (bindu chakra) (7th chakra) is also opened.
There are two sahasara point (a) and (b) sahasara (b) is just where your back bone is attached to skull.
You have one step to go to reach sahasara (b) and it is going to happen soon on full moon night which is coming in April in your area (just check it). Be prepare don't drink alcohol and it is going to be painful as next full moon is supermoon.
Once you open sahasara (b) your vision will become 50–100% more clear and everyday it will give you key to mysteries because sahasara chakra never sleeps it keeps collecting vibrations and information 24x7 and all other chakras have sleep and awaken mode.
May shiva help to experience this wonderful and beautiful existence.
Swami Jai deep"
Why do I always see eyes when I meditate and I m scared of them?,"This is the sign meditation is working and you are about to enter death phase, in this phase you will see death of your loved ones and death of entire world or death of yourself.
In this phase you will find your heart chakra open. In death phase your ego will die and you will enter life phase , but you will need enlightened master and master will give birth to new compassionate ego - this death phase is also called “the dark night of the soul”.
If you don't have Enlightened master then you will move like zombie for many years and it can cause you heaer problems.
Chaos=>Death=>life=>bliss
You are at Chaos phase and about to enter death phase. Don't worry keep doing meditation. Everything will happen on its accord before spiritual awakening."
Which is the best place to go for meditation in India?,"Any place without distraction is fine. Timing is important than place.
Twilight (Name given to time between dawn and sunrise - time between sunset and dusk) is the best timing but you will have to choose one at a time - you can't do both simultaneously ( you may go mad if you do both simultaneously).
Meditation at night will give you soothing dreamless sleep."
"After clearing his consciousness (enlightenment), does a person retain his unique personality?","Consciousness is always pure, only state of No-mind is attained. But mind is still there but it is called when need otherwise your five senses work directly without interference of mind - now this state of No-mind is called samadhi.
There is difference between awakening kundalini and enlightenment.
When Kundalini is awakened there is little change to mind.
With enlightenment person become innocent like child loving , alert but not curious like child.
So basic nature of all enlightened people is same."
How do I differentiate ego from self-respect?,"Ego trip is matter of mind and self-respect is matter of heart. Ego is state of aggression and self-respect is state of transformation.
When somebody spits on your soul , you go deep and reinspect yourself.
Reinspecting your-self is self-respect."
Can Reiki make you cry?,"Only reiki healer who's heart chakra is open can control your energies and certainly make you cry, laugh or sleepy."
Should we fear haters?,"Haters get their energy from your noticing and reaction. Once you become indifferent they will lose their power.
So don't even ignore them, just become indifferent and relax."
Is consciousness real or an illusory belief?,"Only consciousness is real and mind is false weaved on ego, desires , associations and ambitions.
Enlightened people achieve no-mind and then access pure consciousness.
Consciousness is the only real this world is rooted in.
There is individual consciousness and cosmic consciousness. Once you have access to pure consciousness without mind you will connect to source of life.
Consciousness is choiceless it is not affected by what happens to your body and mind. It is like movie screen where whatsoever happens on screen doesn't affect screen (curtain)."
Can Yogi Bhajan's Sat Kriya be practiced alongside Sadhguru's Shambhavi Mahamudra? I am wary if they conflict.,"There are very few people who reached sahasara using their methods.
New man is man who lives in mind and those methods are more than 5000 years old.
Buddha method is latest and Osho method is upgraded version of Buddha.
Follow osho method you will certainly reach sahasara in few years."
Is it dangerous to focus on the Sahasrara chakra during meditation?,"It is not dangerous but it is useless. Meditation should be concerned about your thoughts not body part.
It will be helpful to focus on sahasrara after you enter samadhi - permanent NO-MIND."
Why do you think Jagee Vasudeva is a fraud? Do you have any firm reasons to believe this?,"Anyone who sells courses of spiritualism or self-improvement is not fraud , he is simply a businessman.
Spirituality is something very vague. Anyone can sell just about anything in the name of spirituality.
As a seeker one should try anything and everything on earth till he attains enlightenment.
So don't doubt , just do whatsoever catches your fancy.
You never know what will transcend you to no-mind.
Once you taste no-mind then you will enter the kingdom of God.
Disassociation and desirelessness carry your mind to deathbed and will make you deathless.
Dont desire enlightenment, just seek in just about anything.
Someday when your mind will be ready and your body will be strong you will be available to enlightenment.
Duality is nature of mind."
Can an enlightened person remove the sufferings of other people?,"Enlightened person can do good reiki and he can activate your kundalini by using shaktipat. You can have glimpse of divine and that will help you attain spiritual awakening soon in future.
Enlightened person can use third eye to clear-up and balancing your chakras , which results a good health.
True enlightened person can cure cancer, heart-attack and he can give some years of his age to you also.
He can read your previous births. He can even change his face to give you glimpse of divine.
This world is Maya - holographic. What you see is not exactly the way you see. Enlightened being can see things exactly the way things are.
Just by manipulating energies he can do just about anything and this world is all about energies and consciousness."
How do I remove blockages from the Mooladhara chakra?,"Practice witnessing and have protein rich food.
Also take some herbal testosterone booster."
Are there any enlightened people from whom I can expect guidance about my destiny and learn about life?,"There are many enlightened people and there are many fake enlightened people.
But when you meet enlightened master he will put you through fire of madness and make you experience death and love before you are transformed to totally new being.
If you are looking for material achievements then find some life coach like Robin Sharma and Deepak Chopra."
Spritualisation leads to peace. Is it true?,Absolutely enlightenment is good for consciousness as one can use mind on demand but it is hell for body because sex energy that used to travel downward to muladhar will travel to sahasara (crown chakra).
"Whose preaching do you prefer, Swami Vivekananda or Sadhguru? Why?","There is nothing they can teach you. They are very serious teachers - spirituality should be approached from heart or mind. Most of us live in our mind 24x7. We hardly have few hours of dreamless sleep.
Teachings of Buddha is of mind. First attain no-mind by using your mind then path of tantra is easy to find your 8 chakras in energy body.
You will reach sahasara(b) and you will complete your spiritual journey."
Should no questions be asked to a spiritual master?,No question is relevant if you don’t surrender to master totally and the moment you surrender all questions evaporate. Only the relation between you and master flowers.
Do enlightened people know our past life history?,"Enlightened sage can reveal your past lives only with your consent , otherwise he is not able to penetrate your unconscious mind where all old memories are stored."
What does a chakra physically act like?,"Chakras are vortexes in physical body. There are 7 chakras. First 6 chakras have sleeping and awaken states and seventh chakra has only awaken stage and it keeps collecting information and experiences , energies 24x7.
Chakras vibrate horizontally and vertically and if there is blockage in chakra then it causes health issues."
How can I ensure that I never awaken my Kundalini? I respect it all but I'm more interested in earthly pleasures. I don't want to lose the person I am.,"Awakening of kundalini is not something you can’t notice, it is divine experience and not only you but all the people around you will notice it by your aura.
Kundalini awakening is like blind started to see. If you have glimpse of satori, your life will change immediately.
It is arduous, there are very few lucky people who had it without efforts.
But if it comes without efforts, then it will vanish soon."
What is the difference between ego and attitude?,Attitude is reinforcement of one of the traits of ego at given point of time.
Osho claimed that the active meditation techniques designed by him are an addition to the 112 techniques mentioned in Vijnan Bhairava Tantra whereas Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev says there cannot be more than 112. who is speaking the truth?,Both are saying exactly the same thing - there are 112 meditations but dynamic meditation is combination of four meditations techniques to suit modern lifestyle.
Why do people keep comparing Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev to Osho?,"People love duality and one compares two without having knowledge of the paths they teach. By comparing them they try to find some value in their teaching.
Duality is nature of humans.
Osho teachings are path of mind, it is like using mind to reach heart.
Sadhguru J. Vasudeva path is of yoga (karma). But both paths lead to one destination that is self-realisation.
Both paths reach non-duality."
What are some celebrity presence of mind situations?,Neurotic
"What is more challenging, staying true to yourself or suppressing your true self?","Staying true to yourself is your true nature and it gives you confidence so it is natural not easy although, but supressing true self is artificial and mainly just to live according to others terms to gain attention, affection, self-approval and all those things your ego needs to survive.
Always stay true to yourself, then the magic will start to happen , you will gain self-confidence and respect of others also."
How do I know when I’m observing my thoughts and feelings that it’s not just the ego doing the observing and pretending to be awareness?,"Observing your mind is call witnessing like you can't see your reflection in mirror if it is too close to you, you can't be part of mind while observing there needs a distance to be observer. As J. Krishnamurti says , “ choiceless choice”. The distance that is required is between consciousness and mind(ego), hence only consciousness can be witness (observer).
When you reach NO-MIND then “observer (mind) is observed .
That is enlightenment."
"I had an awakening several months ago. I had no idea what was happening to me or what an awakening was, at that time. Since then, my vision has become clear and I rarely ever have to blink my eyes. Ever heard of this happening to anyone before?","Congrats. If your vision has become clearer that means your 6th chakra (third eye) has opened.
If your eyes have been freezed that means your third eye is working and your 7th chakra has opened. This must be satori(turiya) , but if you don't keep healthy lifestyle and calm state of mind you will slip back from it.
Keep yourself calm means no anger ,jealousy. Don't go out and tell everyone.
Just enjoy it."
How can you prove that greed is really bad?,"Greed and fear are two pillars of our survival. Greed is very basic nature because only greed makes man seeker and that seeking gives meaning to our survival.
Some seek in food, some in sex(girls and positions, ha ha ha) , some seek in designations, some seek in cloths and fashion, some seek in books ,some seek in more cars. some seek in temples, some seek in gurus , but one who seeks inside is seeker of truth , but seeking never ends.
This seeking has the base in greed only, so be greedy and live your life to the fullest."
"Is there an ultimate truth, or is it just perception?","Your true nature is ultimate truth. Once you are able to discard your ego, you will find underneath your true nature.
Ultimate truth of every person is essentially the same ,made of love, compassion and awareness. It is ego that makes everyone unique or different.
Ego is operating system of your brain. Once you format it and install new operating system you will have pure consciousness."
Is enlightenment just part of getting older?,"The moment you start asking - “what is life?” “who am I?”. That is the point you have become seeker , age doesn't matter.
Becoming seeker and getting old has got nothing to do with each other.
We all die by getting old but enlightened person dies by becoming wiser."
Why can't I understand Osho after seeing a wild wild country?,"Nobody can understand Osho, because he used to write like koans or riddles, but one day when you become enlightened ,every word of him makes sense. I can tell you from my experience , he created something that is going to remain in next 2500 years."
"Should I seek revenge at the expense of my freedom, or should I let karma take its course?",Revenue is negative energy opposite of forgiveness like anger is negative energy opposite of fear. You need not waste you positive engeries in favour of negative energy. Then the transformation happens.
Can anyone in the modern era spiritually awaken their mind?,"At present there are more than million of people who are enlightened because now information is readily available on net and you can have very specific information easily available, that makes more people Enlightened.
Someday all the humanity will be Enlightened and this world willl become heaven."
What is the value of spiritual practices like meditation if ultimately the efforts that one puts in is in no way responsible for causing enlightenment? Is it not akin to a dog chasing its own tail eventually realizing that the tail & dog are one?,"Spirituality is not of doing , it is of non-doing. Everybody is seeker as human being. Some seek in food, some seek in cloths, some seek in books, some seek in sex(girls), some seek in music, some seek in temples and prayers, but who seeks inside becomes spiritual and this leads one to self-realisation- true-self.
True-self is same for everyone -all humans are essentially an one whole of love, awareness and compassion. Only ego makes everyone unique and special."
"They say (the scriptures and there authoritarian) if you don't get yourself enlightened, you are trapped into a cycle of rebirths. How do they know it? Have they seen it? Then why are they called ‘everything an illusion of mind’?","One who becomes enlightened dissolves into existence and never to return , basically there is nothing borns or dies. Everything changes form. Everything is energy like Enstien stated in his equation.
Enlightened one just takes other form of energy and others take rebirth in form of new body.
Until we see through our mind this world is Maya, if you see through no-mind then it's real."
"Should you be in a relationship if you're thinking ""what if"" about other people?",The question you asked shows your empathetic nature and answer depends on how empathetic other person is. If other person feels the same then be there with him or her.
Which religion is perfect - Islam/Hinduism/Christianity/some other religion? Why?,All
Why do I get bad visions while meditating in a pooja room alone?,"If you are getting bad vision while meditating (like death of yourself or loved one), then meditation is working, but at this time you need master to help you through. Otherwise you will get complex PTSD taxing your nervous system. This may cause high BP, HIGH heart beats.
Or you quit meditation for few months."
"After enlightenment ""as told by Raman and Osho"" we are nothing and there is nothing that has been expressed in Hindu scriptures than why don't we just live our life and forget the idea of awakening and all those fascinating dimensions?","Enlightenment is not fascinating idea or rather it is very painful process. At every stage you get death like experience and those experiences give you complex PTSD attacks taxing your nervous system.
But everybody is seeker of truth some seek in food, some seek in sex (girls), some seek in temples and one who seeks inside become seeker of truth of himself.
It is nature of human to be seeker and with enlightenment seeking ends forever."
Why do you let your ego prevent you from seeing the truth about yourself?,"Conditioning of many lives crystallizes your ego and ego becomes stubborn and it becomes hardwired into your being. It is very simple to understand but very hard to discard ego and realise true-self.
But once you taste it for a second then your being is transformed into true-self."
What makes Osho different?,"He is not spiritual teacher , he is master of masters. No one can match him in next at least 2500 years."
Is it safe to receive Shaktipat during pregnancy?,"Shaktipat works with your kundalini energy (chakras) and suksham shrir ( astral body), it is absolutely not recommended because that can cause death of your baby, if the energy of shaktipat is not controlled by the medium."
Can any human control rain with spiritual powers?,Yes one who dissolves into existence can cause rain on demand because existence protects and that is why enlightened person can pray for rain for good of humanity.
Is spiritual awakening a fraud which is made up by great Hindu sages so that people would adhere to something which does not even exist?,"Spiritual awakening is very simple process of not watching world through mind. Mind is conditioning and it has operating system as ego.
Once you experience NO-mind then you are enlightened."
Is it true that our soul select our parents before we are born?,Only who has been yogi and couldn't attain enlightenment are able to choose their parents to complete the process of moksha.
What is your favorite stealth meditation that you practice during an ordinary busy day?,Witnessing is the best meditation.
Is there anyone who always live in the moment?,"The moment you attain spiritual awakening ,you live here and now there will be NO-MIND AND THEN YOU TRANSCEND THOS WORLD."
Where should my concentration be during meditation?,"Meditation is not concentration or contemplation , meditation is all about no-mind. Once you reach no-mind, you are at home. You will know your truth.
Everyone is seeker in this world."
"There is a saying, “It's just an illusion, deep inside we are all the same."" Do you agree?","Yes, deep down we are exactly the same only thing that makes everyone unique or different is our ego. Ego makes personality and gratification of ego is to achieve something.
Otherwise everyone is seeker of truth."
What does it mean if I can feel people’s energies?,Awakening of seventh chakra.
Why did Jiddu Krishnamurti say that the spiritual path is individual and no guru or spiritual group can help?,"J. Krishnamurti was enlightened but not mystic, hence he couldn't make a single person enlightened in 70 years. He produced many wonderful books.
J. Krishnamurti was certainly right because spiritual path is individual quest to truth. J. Krishnamurti had bad experiences with studying with Guru from very childhood. Only mystic can help one to attain enlightenment not Guru. But where to find true Guru and forget about true mystic."
Where do people go for moksha?,Inner space
"If I am already a nobody, will enlightenment make me special?",Enlightenment makes you natural. You are special as your ego makes you feel so. Enlightenment is all about erasing all your false beliefs and finding your true-self.
Is self-ego the root cause of suffering and all kinds of miseries and pains?,"Ego is because of desires and achieving mind. Ego is formed with your growing up which includes society, country, desires and feelings like jealousy, hate, guilt,love, greed and anger.
Once you drop ego , you realise your true nature which is full of compassion and love, there is no negative feeling. There is no past and future. With ego everything negative goes away. You become tabula-rasa.
Hence very happiness becomes your true nature."
"How would you explain this, ""Fear is an illusion between you and your possibilities of your life.""?","Nobody in this world without fear. Fear is part of our survival instinct. Fear can't be overcome as long as there is death. One can pretend, one can repress but nobody can eradicate it, to transcend fear , fear has to be understood. If you understand fear you automatically transcend it."
"Do you find the mantra ""I won't let someone steal my joy"" helpful or calming?","This is not at all a mantra, it is more of self-suggestion. Anything you repeat will work as mantra because mantras mean to take your attention from disturbing thoughts."
What does it feel like to be enlightened?,Being enlightened doesn't make anyone feel special but it makes one feel that everyone and everything is special and nothing in this world is without reason.
Is there a way to teach people how to make their super-egos less punitive and harsh?,"Whatsoever you do to anybody's ego , you are going to strengthen their ego. Whatsoever you do to ego straightly , it will crystallize their ego.
It is better you ignore them completely, that is going to work magically."
"Who are we, mind or awareness?",We are consciousness. With awareness we just cross the wall of mind to pure consciousness and true self.
"Why do spiritual teachers like Ekchart Tolle, while claiming to be enlightened still charge money for their books and content (he has a net worth of over 70 million dollars), why do they need more?","Enlightenment and greed has no relationship. Enlightenment simply means one has removed layers of conditioning which we know as ego.
Enlightenment means one lives in no-mind. Enlightened people need everything that ordinary people need.
Enlightenment means one knows his true nature that ordinary people miss because of ego - ego that is result of society and achieving mind.
So it is perfectly okay for Ekchart Tolle to work for money."
