# Telegram Bot üî•
This project is a bot which posts educational content from a csv file to a telegram group at a sceduled time. We are online most of the times so I thought
to use the time for reading educational content . 

So I used node js to build this bot and utilized the <a href="https://core.telegram.org/bots/api/">Telegram Bot API</a> to post messages.
